<h2 class="front">PREFACE</h2>

<p>In continuation of my work on the astronomical uses
of the Egyptian Temples, I have from time to time,
when leisure has permitted, given attention to some of
the stone circles and other stone monuments erected, as I
believed, for similar uses in this country. One reason for
doing so was that in consequence of the supineness of
successive Governments, and the neglect and wanton
destruction by individuals, the British monuments are
rapidly disappearing.</p>

<p>Although, and indeed because, these inquiries are
still incomplete, I now bring together some of the
notes I have collected, as they may induce other
inquirers to go on with the work. Some of the results
already obtained have been communicated to the Royal
Society, and others have appeared in articles published
in <i>Nature</i>, but only a small percentage of the monuments
available has so far been examined. Further
observations are required in order that the hypothesis
set forth in this book may be rejected or confirmed.</p>

<p>In the observations made at Stonehenge referred to
in <a href="#Page62">Chapter VII.</a> I had the inestimable advantage of<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevi">[vi]</span>
the collaboration of the late Mr. Penrose. Our work
there would not have been possible without the sympathetic
assistance of Sir Edmund Antrobus, Bart.;
Colonel Duncan A. Johnston, R.E., Director-General of
the Ordnance Survey, also was good enough on several
occasions to furnish us with much valuable information
which is referred to in its place. Messrs. Howard
Payn and Fowler skilfully and zealously helped in
the observations and computations. To all these I
am glad to take this opportunity of expressing my
obligations.</p>

<p>With regard to the other monuments besides Stonehenge,
I have to tender my thanks to the following
gentlemen for most valuable local <span class="nowrap">assistance:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="thanks">

<p>Brittany&mdash;Lieut. de Vaisseau Devoir.</p>

<p>Stenness&mdash;Mr. Spence.</p>

<p>Stanton Drew&mdash;Professor Lloyd Morgan, Mr. Morrow,
and Mr. Dymond.</p>

<p>The Hurlers, and the Merry Maidens&mdash;the Right Hon.
Viscount Falmouth, Capt. Henderson, Mr. Horton
Bolitho and Mr. Wallis.</p>

<p>Tregaseal&mdash;Mr. Horton Bolitho and Mr. Thomas.</p>

<p>The Dartmoor Avenues&mdash;Mr. Worth.</p>

</div><!--thanks-->

<p>The following have helped me in many ways, among
them with advice and criticism:&mdash;Principal Rhys, Dr.
Wallis Budge, Dr. J. G. Frazer, and Mr. A. L. Lewis.</p>

<p>The assistance so generously afforded in the case of<span class="pagenum" id="Pagevii">[vii]</span>
Stonehenge by Colonel Johnston, R.E., in furnishing me
with accurate azimuths was continued for the monuments
subsequently investigated till his retirement. To his
successor, Colonel R. C. Hellard, R.E., I am already
under deep obligations.</p>

<p>For the use of some of the Illustrations my thanks
are due to the Royal Society, the Society of Antiquaries,
the Royal Institute of British Architects, Messrs. Macmillan,
and Mr. John Murray.</p>

<p>I have to thank Mr. Rolston, F.R.A.S., one of my
staff, for assistance in the computations involved.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER I</span><br />
<span class="h2name">INTRODUCTORY</span></h2>

<p>In the book I published ten years ago, entitled &#8220;The
Dawn of Astronomy,&#8221; I gave a pretty full account of
the principles and the methods of observation which
enable us to trace the ideas which were in the minds of
the ancient Egyptians when they set out the line of
a temple they proposed to build.</p>

<p>Numerous references to the ceremonial of laying the
foundation-stones of temples exist, and we learn from
the works of Chabas, Brugsch, D&uuml;michen<a href="#Footnote1" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor1">[1]</a> and others,
that the foundation of an Egyptian temple was associated
with a series of ceremonies which are repeatedly
described with great minuteness. Amongst these ceremonies,
one especially refers to the fixing of the temple-axis;
it is called, technically, &#8220;the stretching of the
cord,&#8221; and is not only illustrated by inscriptions on the
walls of the temples of Karnak, Denderah and Edfu&mdash;to
mention the best-known cases&mdash;but is referred to
elsewhere.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page2">[2]</span></p>

<p>During the ceremony the king proceeded to the site
where the temple was to be built, accompanied mythically
by the goddess Sesheta, who is styled &#8220;the
mistress of the laying of the foundation-stone.&#8221;</p>

<p>Each was armed with a stake. The two stakes were
connected by a cord. Next the cord was aligned towards
the sun on some day of the year, or a star, as
the case might be; when the alignment was perfect the
two stakes were driven into the ground by means of a
wooden mallet. One boundary wall parallel to the main
axis of the temple was built along the line marked out
by this stretched cord.</p>

<p>If the moment of the rising or setting of the sun
or star were chosen, as we have every reason to believe
was the case, seeing that all the early observations were
made on the horizon, it is obvious that the light from
the body towards which the temple was thus aligned
would penetrate the axis of the temple from one end
to the other in the original direction of the cord.</p>

<p>We learn from Chabas that the Egyptian word which
expresses the idea of founding or laying the foundation-stone
of a temple is <i>Senti</i>&mdash;a word which still exists in
Coptic. But in the old language another word <i>Pet-ser</i>,
which no longer remains in Coptic, has been traced.
It has been established that <i>pet</i> means to stretch, and
<i>ser</i> means cord, so that that part of the ceremonial
which consisted in stretching a cord in the direction of
a star was considered of so great an importance that it
gave its name to the whole ceremonial.</p>

<p>Dealing with the existing remains of Egyptian temples,
it may be said that the most majestic among them was
that of Amen-R&#257; at Karnak, dedicated to the Sun-God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page3">[3]</span>
and oriented to catch the light of the sun setting at
the summer solstice, the time of the year at which the
all-important rise of the Nile began.</p>

<p>Although the sun is no longer worshipped in Egypt
or Britain, sun-worship has not yet disappeared from
the world. Professor Gowland has recently<a href="#Footnote2" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor2">[2]</a> brought to
notice a surviving form of sun-worship in Japan. I
quote his <span class="nowrap">statement:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;There on the seashore at F&ucirc;ta-mi-ga-ura (as will
be seen in a copy of a print which I obtained at that
ancient place) the orientation of the shrine of adoration
is given by two gigantic rocks which rise from the sea
as natural pillars. The sun as it rises over the mountains
of the distant shore is observed between them,
and the customary prayers and offerings made in that
direction (<a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, too, specially worthy of note that the point
from which the sun is revered is marked by a structure
of the form of a trilithon, but made of wood, placed
immediately behind the altar. This representative of
the trilithon is of very remote date in Japan, and has
been in use there from the earliest times in connection
with the observances of the ancient Shint&#333; cult in which
the Sun-Goddess is the chief deity. One of its important
uses, which still survives, was to indicate the
direction of the position of some sacred place or object
of veneration, in order that worshippers might make
their prayers and oblations towards the proper quarter.&#8221;</p>

<p>The table of offerings must also be noted.</p>

<p>In the book to which I have referred, I also endeavoured
to show that a knowledge of even elementary<span class="pagenum" id="Page4">[4]</span>
astronomy may be of very great assistance to students
of arch&aelig;ology, history, folk-lore and all that learning
which deals with man&#8217;s first attempts to grasp the
meaning and phenomena of the universe in which he
found himself before any scientific methods were available
to him; before he had any idea of the origins or
the conditionings of the things around him.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1</span>.&mdash;Present sun worship in Japan.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page5">[5]</span></p>

<p>It may be well, however, in the present book to
restate the underlying astronomical principles in the
briefest possible manner; and this is the more easily
done because, in the absence of measuring instruments,
the horizon was the only circle which the ancient peoples
could employ effectively, and we need only therefore
consider it.</p>

<p>Indeed, whether we regard the Rig-Veda or the
Egyptian monuments from an astronomical point of
view, we are struck by the fact that the early worship
and all the early observations related to the horizon.
This was true not only for the sun, but for all the
stars which studded the general expanse of sky.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>We have therefore chiefly to consider the relation of
the horizon of any place to the apparent movements
of celestial bodies at that place.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>We now know that the earth rotates on its axis, but
this idea was of course quite unknown to these early
peoples. Since the earth rotates, with stars infinitely
removed surrounding it on all sides, the apparent
movements of the stars will depend very much upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page6">[6]</span>
the position we happen to occupy on the earth. An
observer at the North Pole of the earth, for instance,
would see the stars moving round in circles parallel to
the horizon (<a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>). No star could therefore either rise
or set&mdash;one half of the heavens would be always visible
above his horizon, and the other half invisible. An
observer at the South Pole would of course see that<span class="pagenum" id="Page7">[7]</span>
half of the stars invisible to the observer at the
northern one.</p>

<p>If the observer be on the equator, the movements of
the stars will appear to be as indicated in this diagram
(<a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>)&mdash;that is, all the stars will rise and set, and
each star will be, in turn, twelve hours above the horizon,
and the same time below it. But if we consider the
position of an observer in a middle latitude, say at
Stonehenge, we find that some stars will always be
above the horizon, some always below&mdash;that is, they
will neither rise nor set. All other stars will both rise
and set, but some of them will be above the horizon
for a long time and below for a short time, whereas
others will be a very short time above the horizon and
a long time below it, each star completing a circle in a
day (<a href="#Fig4">Fig. 4</a>).</p>

<p>Wherever we are upon the earth we always imagine
that we are on the top of it. The idea held by all
the early peoples was that the surface of the earth
near them was an extended plain: they imagined that
the land that they knew and just the surrounding lands
were really in the centre of the extended plain. Plato,
for instance, was content to think the Mediterranean and
Greece upon the top of a cube, and Anaximander placed
the same region at the top of a cylinder.</p>

<p>By the use of a terrestrial globe we can best study
the conditions of observation at the poles of the earth,
the equator and some place in middle latitude. The
wooden horizon of the globe is parallel to the horizon
of a place at the top of the globe, which horizon we
can represent by a wafer. By inclining the axis of the
globe and watching the movement of the wafer as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page8">[8]</span>
globe is turned round, we can get a very concrete idea
of the different relations of the observer&#8217;s horizon to
the apparent paths of the stars in different latitudes.</p>

<p>We have next to deal with the astronomical relations
of the horizon of any place, in connection with the
observation of the sun and stars at the times of rising
or setting, when of course they are on or near the
horizon; and in order to bring this matter nearer to
the ancient monuments, we will study this question for
both Thebes and Stonehenge. We may take the latitude
of Thebes as 25&deg;, Stonehenge as 51&deg;, and we will
begin with Thebes.</p>

<p>To consider an observer on the Nile at Thebes and
to adjust things properly we must rectify a celestial
globe to the latitude of 25&deg; N., or, in other words,
incline the axis of the globe at that angle to the
wooden horizon.</p>

<p>Since all the stars which pass between the North
Pole and the horizon cannot set, all their apparent
movements will take place above the horizon. All the
stars between the horizon and the South Pole will
never rise. Hence, stars within the distance of 25&deg;
from the North Pole will never set at Thebes, and
those stars within 25&deg; of the South Pole will never be
visible there. At any place the latitude and the elevation
of the pole are the same. It so happens that many
of those places with which arch&aelig;ologists have to do in
studying the history of early peoples&mdash;Chald&aelig;a, Egypt,
Babylonia, &amp;c.&mdash;are in low middle latitudes, therefore
we have to deal with bodies in the skies which do set
and bodies which do not, and the elevation of the
pole is neither very great nor very small. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page9">[9]</span>
although in each different latitude the inclination of
the equator to the horizon as well as the elevation of
the pole will vary, there will be a strict relationship
between the inclination of the equator at each place
and the elevation of the pole. Except at the poles
themselves the equator will cut the horizon due east
and due west; therefore every celestial body to the north
of the celestial equator which rises and sets will cut the
horizon between the east and west point and the north
point; those bodies which do not rise will of course
not cut the horizon at all.</p>

<p>The stars near the equator, and the sun, in such
a latitude as that of Thebes, will appear to rise
or set at no very considerable angle from the vertical;
but when we deal with stars very near to the north or
south points of the horizon they will seem to skim
along the horizon instead of rising directly.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">We now pass on to Stonehenge. To represent the
new condition the axis of the globe will now require
to be inclined 51&deg; to the horizon. The number of
northern stars which do not set and of southern stars
which do not rise will be much greater than at
Thebes. The most northern and southern stars visible
will in their movement hug the horizon more closely
than was observed under the Thebes condition.</p>

<p>The sun, both at Thebes and Stonehenge, since it
moves among the stars from 23<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg; N. to 23<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg; S. each year,
will change its place of rising and setting at different
times of the year.</p>

<p>Now it will at once be obvious that there must be
a strict law connecting the position of a star with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page10">[10]</span>
place of rising or setting. Stars at the same distance
from the celestial pole or equator will rise or set at
the same point of the horizon, and if a star does not
change its place in the heavens it will always rise or
set in the same place.</p>

<p>The sun as it changes its position each day, in its
swing N. and S. of the equator, will rise and set on
any day in the same place as a star which permanently
has the same distance from the equator as that temporarily
occupied by the sun.</p>

<p>Here it will be convenient to introduce one or two
technical terms: we generally define a star&#8217;s place by
giving, as one ordinate, its distance in degrees from the
equator: this distance is called its <i>declination</i>.</p>

<p>Further, we generally define points on the horizon
by dividing its whole circumference into 360&deg;, so that
we can have <i>azimuths</i> up to 90&deg; from the north and south
points to the east and west points. We also have
<i>amplitudes</i> from the east and west points towards the
north and south points. We can say, then, that a
star of a certain declination, or the sun when it
occupies that declination, will rise or set at such an
azimuth, or at such an amplitude. This will apply to
both north and south declinations.</p>

<p>Then supposing the azimuth to be 39&deg; in the N.E.
quadrant, it is written N. 39&deg; E. For the other quadrants
we have N. 39&deg; W., S. 39&deg; E., and S. 39&deg; W.,
respectively.</p>

<p>The following table gives the amplitudes of rising or
setting (north or south) of celestial bodies having
declinations from 0&deg; to 64&deg;, at Thebes and Stonehenge
respectively.</p>

Stonehenge, so that still more northerly monuments
can be considered.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER II</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE ASTRONOMICAL DIVISIONS OF THE YEAR</span></h2>


<p>It is next important to deal with the yearly path
of the sun, with a view of studying the relation of the
various points of the horizon occupied by the sun at
different times in the year. In the very early observations
that were made in Egypt, Chald&aelig;a and elsewhere,
when the sun was considered to be a god who every
morning got into his boat and floated across space,
there was no particular reason for considering the
amplitude at which the boat left, or came to, shore.
But a few centuries showed that this rising or setting
of the sun in widely varying amplitudes at different
times of the year at the same place obeyed a very
definite law.</p>

<p>In its northward passage it reaches the highest point
at our summer solstice, and then goes down again till
it reaches its greatest southern declination, as it does
in our winter. At both these points the sun appears to
stand still in its north or south movement, and the
Latin word solstice exactly expresses that idea. The
change of declination brought about by these movements
will affect the place of the sun&#8217;s rising and setting;
this is why the sun sets most to the north in<span class="pagenum" id="Page13">[13]</span>
summer and most to the south in winter. At the
equinoxes the sun has always 0&deg; Decl., so it rises and
sets due east and west all over the world. But at
the solstices it has its greatest declination of 23<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg;
N. or S.; it will rise and set therefore furthest from
the east and west points; how far, will depend upon
the latitude of the place, as will have been gathered
from the preceding table (<a href="#Page11">p. 11</a>).</p>

<p>These solstices and their accompaniments are among
the striking things in the natural world. In the
winter solstice we have the depth of winter, in the
summer solstice we have the height of summer, while
at the equinoxes we have but transitional changes; in
other words, while the solstices point out for us the
conditions of greatest heat and greatest cold, the
equinoxes point out for us those two times of the year
at which the temperature conditions are very nearly
equal, although of course in the one case we are saying
good-bye to summer and in the other to winter.</p>

<p>Did the ancients know anything about these solstices
and these equinoxes? Dealing with the monumental
evidence in Egypt alone, the answer is absolutely overwhelming.
Many thousand years ago the Egyptians
were perfectly familiar with the solstices, and therefore
with the yearly path of the sun.</p>

<p>This fundamental division of the sun&#8217;s apparent revolution
and course which define our year into four
nearly equal parts may be indicated as in <a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5</a>, the
highest point reached by the sun in our northern
hemisphere being represented at the top.</p>

</div><!--figcenter-->

<p>In order better to consider the problem as it was presented
to the early astronomers who built observatories<span class="pagenum" id="Page14">[14]</span>
(temples) to mark these points, we may deal with the
bearings of the points occupied by the sun on the
horizon (either at rising or setting) at the times indicated.
These points are defined, as we have seen, by
their &#8220;amplitude&#8221; or their distance in degrees from the
E. or W. points of the horizon. In the diagram (<a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page15">[15]</span>
I represent the conditions of our chief British sun-temple,
Stonehenge, in latitude 51&deg; N. approximately.</p>

<p>Taking the astronomical facts regarding the solstices
and equinoxes for the first year (1901) of the present
century, we <span class="nowrap">find&mdash;</span></p>

<p>These points, then, are approximately ninety-one days
apart (91 &times; 4 = 364).</p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a> I deal with the &#8220;amplitudes&#8221; at Stonehenge,
that is, the angular distance along the horizon
from the E. and W. points, at which the sunrise and
sunset are seen at the solstices; at the equinoxes
they are seen at the E. and W. points. But as these
amplitudes vary with the latitude and therefore depend
upon the place of observation, a more general treatment
is possible if we deal with the declination of the
sun itself, that is, its angular distance from the equator.</p>

<p>The maximum declination depends upon the obliquity
of the ecliptic, that is, the angle between the
plane of the ecliptic and that of the equator at the
time of observation. When the Stonehenge Sarsen
Stones were erected this angle was, as I shall show
later on, 23&deg; 54&#8242; 30&#8243;. Its mean value for the present
year (1906) is 23&deg; 27&#8242; 5&#8243;; it is decreasing very slowly.</p>

<p>It will be obvious from <a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a> that in temples built
to observe the solstices or equinoxes, if they were open
from end to end, looking in one direction we should
see the sun rising at a solstice or equinox, and looking
in the other we should see the sun setting at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page16">[16]</span>
opposite one. I shall show later on that this statement
requires a slight modification.</p>

<p>But temples so built interfered with the ceremonial,
which required that the light should illuminate a naos&mdash;that
is, the Sanctuary or Holy of Holies, only entered
by the High Priest, and generally kept dark. Usually,
therefore, two temples were built back to back, with a
common axis, as at Karnak.</p>

<p>And here a very important point comes in; which
time of the year and day of the year are most easy to
fix by astronomical observation? As a matter of fact the
summer solstice, the position of the sun on the longest
day, is a point easily fixed. All we have to do is to
observe the sun rising more and more to the north
as the summer approaches, until at the very height of
the summer we have the extreme north-easterly point
of the horizon reached, and the sun stands still. We
have the solstice. We can then put a row of stakes
up, and so fix the solstitial line. Of course we find,
as mankind has found generally, that the sun comes
back next year to that same solstitial place of rising
or setting. So that when we have once got such an
alignment for the rising of the sun at midsummer, we
can determine the length of the year in days, and
therefore the beginning of each year as it comes round.</p>

<p>So much, then, for the chief points in what we may
term the astronomical year, those at which the sun&#8217;s
declination is greatest and least. We see that they are
approximately ninety-one days apart&mdash;say three months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page17">[17]</span></p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER III</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE AGRICULTURAL DIVISIONS OF THE YEAR</span></h2>

<p>The early peoples have been very much misrepresented,
and held to have been uninstructed, by several
writers who have not considered what they were really
driving at. It was absolutely essential for early man,
including the inhabitants of Britain as it was then&mdash;townless,
uncivilised&mdash;that the people should know
something about the proper time for performing their
agricultural operations. We now go into a shop and
for a penny buy an almanack which gives us everything
we want to know about the year, the month
and the day, and that is the reason why so few of us
care about astronomy: we can get all we want from
astronomy for a penny or twopence. But these poor
people, unless they found out the time of the year and
the month and the day for themselves, or got some one
to tell them&mdash;and their priests were the men who
knew, and they were priests because they knew&mdash;had
absolutely no means of determining when their various
agricultural operations should take place. So that we
find all over the world temples erected in the very first
flush of civilisation.</p>

<p>On this a point comes in of very considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page18">[18]</span>
interest. If we study the civilisations in Egypt, we
find that, so far as we know, one of the first peoples
who used this principle of orientation for agricultural
purposes was some tribe that came down the Nile about
6400 years <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> They used the star Canopus, and their
determination was that of the autumnal equinox, which
practically was the time when the Nile began to go
down, and when their sowing might begin. There
was another race who, instead of being interested
in the sun, and therefore in agriculture, at the time of
the autumnal equinox, were interested in the year
about the time of Easter as well. This race built the
Pyramids about four thousand years <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> There was an
interval of about two or three thousand years between
these races. As we shall see there were others, who at
Thebes started the solstitial worship&mdash;that is to say,
the worship of the sun at midsummer&mdash;and at Memphis
in May, so as to enable them to go on with their
agricultural operations with greater certainty. We must
not forget that first of all the farmers tried to plough
and sow by the moon. We can see how hopeless
agriculture must have been under such conditions. The
month, indeed, was the only unit of time employed,
even of human life. We hear of people who lived
1200 years; that means 1200 months&mdash;there is no
question whatever about that now.</p>

<p>When we study the history of our own country&mdash;when
we come back from Egypt to Britain, leaving alone
Greece and Rome&mdash;we find that in various times in our
country we have had a year, a farmer&#8217;s year, beginning
in the month of May; we have had another farmer&#8217;s<span class="pagenum" id="Page19">[19]</span>
year beginning in the month of August; we have had
another farmer&#8217;s year beginning at the longest day;
and it appears that the year beginning at the longest
day was really the last year to be introduced. So that
while we have in Stonehenge a solstitial temple&mdash;that is
to say, a temple to make observations of the length of the
year by observing the rise of the sun on the longest
day of the year&mdash;in other parts of England there were
other temples observing the sun, not on the 21st of
June, but early in May and early in August.</p>

<p>Now, as I have indicated, the priest-astronomers in
these temples could only have won and kept the respect
of the agricultural population with whom alone they
were surrounded in early times, and by whom they
were supported, by being useful to them in some way
or another. This could only have been in connection
with what we may term generally the <i>farming</i> operations
necessary at different times of the year, whether
in the shape of preparing the ground or gathering the
produce. For this they must have watched the stars.</p>

<p>A very large part of mythology has sprung out of
the temple cults, prayer, sacrifices and thanksgiving
connected with these farming operations in different
lands and ages.</p>

<p>I wish to show next that by studying the orientation
of temples erected to watch the stars and sunrise and
sunset at times other than the solstices or equinoxes, an
immense amount of information may be gained if we
endeavour to find the way in which the problem must
have been attacked before the year was thoroughly
established, and when it was still a question of grass- or<span class="pagenum" id="Page20">[20]</span>
corn-kings or gods who had to be propitiated; and
we may even be enabled to understand why the
particular divisions of the year were chosen.</p>

<p>In a solstitial temple the sun makes its appearance
only once a year, when it reaches its greatest north or
south declination; but in the temples dealing with
lower declinations the sun appears twice, once on its
journey from the summer to the winter solstice, and
again on its return.</p>

<p>The first difficulty of the inquiry in the direction I
have indicated arises from the fact that the products of
different countries vary, and that identical farming operations
have to be carried on at different times in these
countries. We must, then, begin with some one
country, and as the record is fullest for Greece I will
begin with it.</p>

<p>The first thing we find is that the chief points in the
farmer&#8217;s year in Greece are about as far from the fixed
points in the astronomical year as they well can be.</p>

<p>In the Greek information so admirably collated by
M. Ruelle in the article on the calendar in Daremberg
and Saglio&#8217;s monumental &#8220;Dictionnaire des Antiquit&eacute;s
Grecques et Romaines,&#8221; the earlier Gregorian dates on
which the seasons were reckoned to commence in ancient
Greece were as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<table class="standard dontwrap fsize90" summary="Seasons">

<p>I may also add from the same source that in the
calendars of the Latins the dates <span class="nowrap">become:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page21">[21]</span></p>

</table>

<p>Now we see at once that these dates are, roughly,
half-way between the solstices and equinoxes.</p>

<p>This, then, at once brings us back to the orientation
problem, which was to fix by means of a temple in the
ordinary way dates nearer to these turning-points in
the local farmer&#8217;s years than those fixed by the solstitial
and equinoctial temples.</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind that it is not merely a
question of stately piles such as Karnak and the Parthenon
in populous centres, but of the humblest dolmen
or stone circle, in scattered agricultural communities,
which was as certainly used for orientation purposes,
that is, for recording the lapse of time at night or return
of some season important to the tiller of the soil. The
advent of the season thus determined could be announced
to outlying districts by fire signals at night.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that any temple, dolmen
or cromlech oriented to a sunrise or sunset at any dates
between the solstices will receive the sunlight twice a
year.</p>

<p>If the temple is pointed nearly solstitially the two dates
at which the sun appears in it will be near the solstice;
similarly, for a temple pointed nearly equinoctially the
dates will be near the equinox; but if the ancients wished
to divide the ninety-one days&#8217; interval between the
solstice and equinox, a convenient method of doing this
would be to observe the sun at the half-time interval,
such that the same temple would serve on both<span class="pagenum" id="Page22">[22]</span>
occasions. This could be done by orienting the temple
to the sun&#8217;s place on the horizon when it had the
declination 16&deg; 20&#8242; on its upward and downward journey,
or, in other words, was, <i>in days</i>, half-way between
the equinox and solstice. Thus, for the 45 days
<span class="fsize150">(</span><span class="horsplit"><span class="top">91 days</span>
<span class="bot">2</span></span><span class="fsize150">)</span>
from March 22, we have <span class="nowrap">in&mdash;</span></p>

<p>What, then, are the non-equinoctial, non-solstitial
days of the year when the sun has this declination?</p>

<p>They are, in the sun&#8217;s journey from the vernal

<p>We get, then, a year symmetrical with the astronomical
year, which can be indicated with it as in
<a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>; a year roughly halving the intervals between
the chief dates of the astronomical year.</p>

<p>With regard to the dates shown I have already
pointed out that farming operations would not occur at
the same time in different lands; that ploughing and
seed time and harvest would vary with crops and
latitudes; and I must now add that when we wish to<span class="pagenum" id="Page23">[23]</span>
determine the exact days of the month we have to
struggle with all the difficulties introduced by the various
systems adopted by different ancient nations to bring
together the reckoning of months by the moon and of
years by the sun.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig7">

<img src="images/illo035.png" alt="" width="500" height="426" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 7</span>.&mdash;The astronomical and vegetation divisions of the year.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>In more recent times there is an additional difficulty
owing to the incomplete reconstruction of the calendar
by Julius C&aelig;sar, who gave us the Julian year. Thus,
while the spring equinox occurred on March 21 at the
time of the Council of Nice, in 325 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span>, by the year
1751 the dating of the year on which it took place had
slipped back to the 10th. Hence the Act 24 George II.
c. 23, by which September 2, 1752, was followed by
September 14 instead of by the 3rd, thus regaining the
eleven days lost. This change from the so-called &#8220;old
style&#8221; to the &#8220;new style&#8221; is responsible for a great
deal of confusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page24">[24]</span></p>

<p>Another cause of trouble was the forsaking by the
Jews of the solar year, with which they commenced, in
favour of the Babylonian lunar year, which has been
continued for the purposes of worship by Christians,
giving us &#8220;movable feasts&#8221; to such an extent that
Easter Day, which once invariably marked the spring
equinox, may vary from March 22 to April 25, and
Whit Sunday from May 10 to June 13. It is at once
obvious that no fixed operations of Nature can be
indicated by such variable dates as these.</p>

<p>Hence in what follows I shall only deal with the
months involved; these amply suffice for a general
statement, but a discussion as to exact dates may come
later.</p>

<p>To sum up, then, the astronomer-priests had (1) to
watch the time at night by observing a star rising near
the north point of the horizon. This star would act as a
warner of sunrise at some time of the year.</p>

<p>(2) To watch for the rising or setting of other stars
in various azimuths warning sunrise at the other critical
times of the May or Solstitial years.</p>

<p>(3) To watch the sunrise and sunset.</p>

<p>(4) To mark all rising or setting places of the warning
stars and sun by sight-lines from the circle.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER IV</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE VARIOUS NEW-YEAR DAYS</span></h2>

<p>With regard to the astronomical year it may be stated
that each solstice and equinox has in turn in some
country or another, and even in the same country at
different times, been taken as the beginning of the year.</p>

<p>We have, then, to begin with, the following which may
be called <i>astronomical</i> <span class="nowrap">years:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It will have been gathered from <a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a> that the
temples or cromlechs erected to watch the first sunrise of
the May-November-May year could also perform the same
office for the August-February-August year; and in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page26">[26]</span>
stone circle the priests, by looking along the axis almost
in an opposite direction, could note the sunsets marking
the completion of the half of the sun&#8217;s yearly round
in November and February.</p>

<p>Now to those who know anything of the important
contributions of Grimm, Rh&#375;s, Frazer, and many others
we might name, to our knowledge of the mythology,
worships, and customs in the Mediterranean basin and
western Europe, an inspection of the first columns in the
above tables will show that here we have a common
meeting-ground for temple orientation, vegetation and
customs depending on it, religious festivals, and mythology.
From the Egyptian times at least to our own a generic
sun-god has been specifically commemorated in each of
the named months. Generic customs with specific differences
are as easily traced in the same months; while
generic vegetation with specific representatives proper to
the season of the year has been so carefully regarded that
even December, though without May flowers or August
harvests, not to be outdone, brings forward its offering in
the shape of the berries of the mistletoe and holly.</p>

<p>About the mistletoe there is this difficulty. Innumerable
traditions associate it with worship and the oak
tree. Undoubtedly the year in question was the solstitial
year, so that so far as this goes the association
is justified. But as a rule the mistletoe does not grow
on oaks. This point has been frequently inquired into,
especially by Dr. Henry Ball (<i>Journal of Botany</i>, vol.
ii. p. 361, 1864) in relation to the growth of the plant in
Herefordshire, and by a writer in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>
(vol. cxiv.), who spoke of the mistletoe &#8220;deserting the
oak&#8221; in modern times and stated, &#8220;it is now so rarely<span class="pagenum" id="Page27">[27]</span>
found on that tree as to have led to the suggestion that
we must look for the mistletoe of the Druids, not in the
<i>Viscum album</i> of our own trees and orchards, but in the
<i>Loranthus Europaeus</i> which is frequently found on oaks
in the south of Europe.&#8221;</p>

<p>On this point I consulted two eminent botanical
friends, Mr. Murray, of the British Museum, and Prof.
Farmer, from whom I have learned that the distribution
of <i>V. album</i> is in Europe universal except north of
Norway and north of Russia; in India in the temperate
Himalayas from Kashmir to Nepaul, altitude 3000 to
7000 feet.</p>

<p>The <i>Viscum aureum</i>, otherwise called <i>Loranthus
Europaeus</i>, is a near relation of the familiar mistletoe,
and in Italy grows on the oak almost exclusively. There
are fifty species of Loranthus in the Indian flora, but
<i>L. Europaeus</i> does not occur.</p>

<p>In the <i>Viscum aureum</i> we have the &#8220;golden bough,&#8221;
the oak-borne <i>Aurum frondens</i> and <i>Ramus aureus</i> of
Virgil; and it can easily be imagined that when the
Druids reached our shores from a country which had
supplied them with the <i>Viscum aureum</i>, this would be
replaced by the <i>V. album</i> growing chiefly on apple
trees and not on oaks; indeed, Mr. Davies, in his
&#8220;Celtic Researches,&#8221; tells us that the apple was the
next sacred tree to the oak, and that apple orchards
were planted in the vicinity of the sacred groves. The
transplanting of the mistletoe from the apple to the
oak tree before the mystic ceremonies began was not
beyond the resources of priestcraft.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that these ceremonies took
place at both solstices&mdash;once in June, when the oak was<span class="pagenum" id="Page28">[28]</span>
in full leaf, and again in December, when the parasitic
plant was better visible in the light of the young moon.
Mr. Frazer, in his &#8220;Golden Bough&#8221; (iii. p. 328), points
out that at the summer solstice not only was mistletoe
gathered, but many other &#8220;magic plants, whose evanescent
virtue can be secured at this mystic season
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is the ripening of the berries at the winter solstice
which secured for the mistletoe the paramount importance
the ceremonials connected with it possessed at
that time, when the rest of the vegetable world was
dormant.</p>

<p>With regard especially to the particular time of the
year chosen for sun-worship and the worship of the
gods and solar heroes connected with the years to
which I have referred, I may add that the vague year
in Egyptian chronology makes it a very difficult matter
to determine the exact Gregorian dates for the ancient
Egyptian festivals, but, fortunately, there is another
way of getting at them. Mr. Roland Mitchell, when
compiling his valuable &#8220;Egyptian Calendar&#8221; (Luzac and
Co., 1900), found that the Koptic calendar really presents
to us the old Egyptian year, &#8220;which has been in
use for thousands of years, and has survived all the
revolutions.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the many festivals included in the calendar, the
great Tanta fair, which is also a Mohammedan feast.
&#8220;is the most important of all held in Egypt. Religion,
commerce, and pleasure offer combined attractions.&#8221; As
many as 600,000 or 700,000 often attend this great
fair, &#8220;no doubt the survival of one of the ancient
Egyptian national festivals.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page29">[29]</span></p>

<p>It is held so as to end on a Friday, and in 1901 the
Friday was August 9!</p>

<p>This naturally suggests that we should look for a
feast in the early part of May. We find the Festival
of Al-Khidr, or Elias in the middle of the wheat
harvest in Lower Egypt; of this we <span class="nowrap">read:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Al-Khidr is a mysterious personage, who, according
to learned opinion, was a just man, or saint, the Vis&#299;r
of Dhu&#8217;l-Karn&ecirc;n (who was a great conqueror, contemporary
with Ibrah&#299;m&mdash;Abraham&mdash;and identified in other
legends with Alexander the Great, St. George, &amp;c.).
Al-Khidr, it is believed, still lives, and will live until
the Day of Judgment. He is clad in green garments,
whence probably the name. He is commonly identified
with Elias (Elijah), and this confusion seems due to a
confusion or similarity of some of the attributes that
tradition assigns to both.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The &#8216;Festival of El-Khidr and of Elias,&#8217; falling
generally on May 6, marks the two-fold division of the
year, in the Turkish and Armenian calendars, into the
R&#363;z K&#257;sim and the R&#363;z Khidr (of 179-80 and 185-6
days respectively).&#8221;</p>

<p>This last paragraph is important, as it points to
ancient sun-worship, Helios being read for Elias; and 179
days from May 6 bring us to November 1. So we find
that the modern Turks and Armenians have the old
May-November year as well as the ancient Egyptians
who celebrated it in the Temple of Menu at Thebes.</p>

<p>The traces of the Ptah worship are not so obvious.
Finally, it may be stated that the second Tanta fair
occurs at the spring equinox, so that the pyramid
worship can still be traced in the modern Egyptian<span class="pagenum" id="Page30">[30]</span>
calendar. The proof that this was an exotic<a href="#Footnote3" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor3">[3]</a> is established,
I think, by the fact that no important agricultural
operations occur at this period in Egypt, while
in May we have the harvest, in August and November
sowing, going on.</p>

<p>A cursory examination of Prof. Rh&#375;s&#8217; book containing
the Hibbert Lectures of 1886, in the light of these
years, used as clues, suggests that in Ireland the
sequence was May-November (Fomori and Fir Bolg),
August-February (Lug and the Tuatha D&eacute; Danann),
and, lastly, June-December (C&uacute;chulainn). Should this
be confirmed we see that the farmers&#8217; years were the
first to be established, and it is interesting to note that
the agricultural rent year in many parts of Ireland still
runs from May to November. It is well also to bear
in mind, if it be established that the solstitial year
did really arrive last, that the facts recorded by Mr.
Frazer in his &#8220;Golden Bough&#8221; indicate that the
custom of lighting fires on hills has been in historic
times most prevalent at the summer solstice; evidently
maps showing the geographical distribution of the May,
June, and August fires would be of great value.</p>

<p>Some customs of the May and August years are
common to the solstitial and equinoctial years. Each
was ushered in by fires on hills and the like; flowers
in May and the fruits of the earth in August are
associated with them; there are also special customs
in the case of November. In western Europe, however,
it does not seem that such traditions exist over such a<span class="pagenum" id="Page31">[31]</span>
large area as that over which the remnants of the
solstitial practices have been traced.</p>

<p>I have pointed out that both the May and August
years began when the sun had the same declination
(16&deg; N. or thereabouts); once, on its ascent from March
to the summer solstice in June, again in its decline
from the solstice to September. Hence it may be more
difficult in this case to disentangle and follow the
mythology, but the two years stand out here and
there. With regard to August, Mr. Penrose&#8217;s orientation
data for the Panathen&aelig;a fix the 19th day (Gregorian)
for the festival in the Hecatompedon; similar celebrations
were not peculiar to western Europe and Greece,
as a comparison of dates of worship will show.</p>

<p>In the above table I have given both the dates on
which the sunlight (at rising or setting) entered the
temple, but we do not know for certain, except in the
case of the Hecatompedon, on which of the two days
the temples were used; it is likely they were all used
on both days, and that the variation from the dates
proper to the sun&#8217;s declination of N. 16&deg; indicates that
they were very accurately oriented to fit the local
vegetation conditions in the most important and extensive
temple fields in the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page32">[32]</span></p>

<p>This is the more probable because the Jews also, after
they had left Egypt, established their feast of Pentecost
fifty days after Easter = May 10, on which day
loaves made of newly harvested corn formed the chief
offering.</p>

<p>With regard to the equinoctial year, the most complete
account of the temple arrangements is to be found
in Josephus touching that at Jerusalem. The temple
had to be so erected that at the spring equinox the
sunrise light should fall on, and be reflected to, the
worshippers by the sardonyx stones on the high priest&#8217;s
garment. At this festival the first barley was laid upon
the altar.</p>

<p>But this worship was in full swing in Egypt for
thousands of years before we hear of it in connection
with the Jews. It has left its temples at Ephesus,
Athens, and other places, and with the opening of this
year as well as of the solstitial one the custom of
lighting fires is associated, not only on hills, but also
in churches.</p>

<p>Here the sequence of cult cannot be mistaken. We
begin with Isis and the young Sun-god Horus at the
Pyramids, and we end with &#8220;Lady Day,&#8221; a British legal
date; while St. Peter&#8217;s at Rome is as truly oriented
to the equinox as the Pyramids themselves, so that
we have a distinct change of cult with no change of
orientation.</p>

<p>If such considerations as these help us to connect
Egyptian with British worships we may hope that they
will be no less useful when we go further afield. I
gather from a study of Mr. Maudslay&#8217;s admirable plans
of Palenque and Chich&eacute;n-Itz&aacute; that the solstitial and<span class="pagenum" id="Page33">[33]</span>
farmers&#8217; years&#8217; worships were provided for there. How
did these worships and associated temples with naos
and sphinxes<a href="#Footnote4" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor4">[4]</a> get from Egypt to Yucatan? The more
we know of ancient travel the more we are convinced
that it was coastwise, that is, from one point of visible
land to the next. Are the cults as old as differences
in the coast-lines which would most easily explain their
wide distribution?</p>

<span class="h2name">CONDITIONS AND TRADITIONS AT STONEHENGE</span></h2>

<p>After Mr. Penrose, by his admirable observations in
Greece, had shown that the orientation theory accounted
as satisfactorily for the directions in which the chief
temples in Greece had been built as I had shown it did
for some in Egypt, it seemed important to apply the
same methods of inquiry with all available accuracy to
some example, at all events, of the various stone circles
in Britain which have so far escaped destruction. Many
attempts had been previously made to secure data, but
the instruments and methods employed did not seem to
be sufficient.</p>

<p>Much time has, indeed, been lost in the investigation
of a great many of these circles, for the reason that in
many cases the relations of the monuments to the chief
points of the horizon have not been considered; and
when they were, the observations were made only with
reference to the magnetic north, which is different at
different places, and besides is always varying; few indeed
have tried to get at the astronomical conditions of
the problem.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page35">[35]</span></p>

<p>The first, I think, was Mr. Jonathan Otley, who
in 1849 showed the &#8220;Orientation&#8221; of the Keswick
Circle &#8220;according to the solar meridian,&#8221; giving true
solar bearings throughout the year.</p>

<p>I wrote a good deal in <i>Nature</i><a href="#Footnote5" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor5">[5]</a> on sun and star
temples in 1891, and Mr. Lewis the next year expressed
the opinion that the British Stone Monuments,
or some of them, were sun and star temples.</p>

<p>Mr. Magnus Spence of Deerness in Orkney published
a pamphlet, &#8220;Standing Stones and Maeshowe of Stenness,<a href="#Footnote6" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor6">[6]</a>&#8221;
in 1894; it is a reprint of an article in the
<i>Scottish Review</i>, Oct. 1893. Mr. Cursiter, F.S.A., of
Kirkwall, in a letter to me dated 15 March 1894,
a letter suggested by my <i>Dawn of Astronomy</i> which
appeared in that year and in which the articles which
had appeared in <i>Nature</i> in 1891 had been expanded,
drew my attention to the pamphlet; the observations
had no pretension to scientific accuracy, and
although some of the sight-lines were incorrectly shown
in an accompanying map, May year and solstitial alignments
were indicated.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">So far as I know, there has never been a complete
inquiry into the stone circles in Britain, but Mr. Lewis,
who has paid great attention to these matters, has dealt
in a general manner with them (<i>Archaeological Journal</i>,
vol. xlix. p. 136), and has further described (<i>Journal</i>
Anthropological Institute, n.s., iii., 1900) the observations
made by him of stone circles in various parts of
Scotland. From an examination of the latter he concludes<span class="pagenum" id="Page36">[36]</span>
that they may be divided into different types,
each of which has its centre in a different locality. The
types are&mdash;(1) the Western Scottish type, consisting of a
rather irregular single ring or sometimes of two concentric
rings; (2) the Inverness type, consisting of a
more regular ring of better-shaped stones, surrounding a
tumulus with a retaining wall, containing a built-up
chamber and passage leading to it, or a kist without a
passage; (3) the Aberdeen type, consisting of a similar
ring with the addition of a so-called &#8220;altar-stone&#8221; and
usually having traces of a tumulus and kist in the
middle. In addition to these three types of circles,
there are in Britain generally what Mr. Lewis calls sun
and star circles, with their alignments of stones, and
apparently proportioned measurements. He has shown
that there is a great preponderance of outlying stones
and hill-tops lying between the circles and the N.E.
quarter of the horizon. From what has been stated
in <a href="#Page17">Chapter III</a> with regard to the nightly observations of
stars it will be gathered that these may have been used
for this purpose.</p>

<p>The following list gives some of the bearings of
outlying stones and other circles from the centres of
the named <span class="nowrap">circles:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>If these alignments mean anything they must of course
refer to the rising of <i>stars</i>, as the position on the horizon
is outside the sun&#8217;s path.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page37">[37]</span></p>

<p>The many circles in Cornwall have been dealt with by
Mr. Lukis in a volume published by the Society of
Antiquaries in 1895.<a href="#Footnote7" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor7">[7]</a> A carefully prepared list of
circles will be found in Mr. Windle&#8217;s recently published
work entitled &#8220;Remains of the Prehistoric Age in
England.&#8221;</p>

<p>It may be useful here to state, with regard to megalithic
remains generally, that they may be classed as
follows; some details will be discussed later on.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Circles. These may be single, double, or multiple,
and either concentric or not.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Menhirs, large single stones, used to mark sight-lines
from circles.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Alignments, <i>i.e.</i>, lines of stones in single, double,
or in many parallel lines. If these alignments are short
they are termed avenues.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Holed-stones, doubtless used for observing sight-lines,
sometimes <i>over</i> a circle.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Coves. A term applied by Dr. Stukeley and others
to what they considered shrines formed by three upright
stones, thus leaving one side open. I take them
to be partially protected observing places. There are
well-marked examples at Avebury, Stanton Drew and
Kit&#8217;s Coity House.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Cromlechs. This term generally means a grouping
of upright stones; it is applied to irregular circles in
Brittany. It also applies to a stone or stones raised on
the summits of three or more pillar stones forming the
end and sides of an irregular vault generally open
at one end (&#8220;Dolmens of Ireland,&#8221; Borlase, p. 429).<span class="pagenum" id="Page38">[38]</span>
The top stone is called in S.W. England a &#8220;quoit.&#8221;
Cromlechs in most cases have been covered by barrows
or cairns.</p>

<p>(<i>g</i>) Dolmens, from Dol Men, a table stone. These
consist of stones, resting on two or more upright
stones forming a more or less complete chamber,
some of which are of great length. I note the
following subdivisions: &#8220;Dolmen &agrave; galerie&#8221; having an
entrance way of sufficient height, and &#8220;Galgal,&#8221; similar
but smaller. In the &#8220;Dolmen &agrave; l&#8217;all&eacute;e couverte&#8221;
there is a covered passage way to the centre. It
is a more elaborate cove. For the relation between
cromlechs and dolmens, see Borlase (<i>loc. cit.</i> and
p. 424 <i>et seq.</i>).</p>

<p>With regard to dolmens, I give the following quotation
from Mr. Penrose (<i>Nature</i>, vol. lxiv., September 12,
<span class="nowrap">1901):&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Near Locmariaquer in the estuary named Rivi&egrave;re
d&#8217;Auray, there is an island named Gavr&#8217; Inis, or Goat
Island, which contains a good specimen of the kind of
dolmen which has been named &#8216;Galgal.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;At the entrance our attention is at once arrested by
the profusion of tracery which covers the walls. From
the entrance to the wall facing us the distance is between
50 and 60 feet. The square chamber to which
the gallery leads is composed of two huge slabs, the
sides of the room and gallery being composed of upright
stones, about a dozen on each side. The mystic lines
and hieroglyphics similar to those above mentioned
appear to have a decorative character.</p>

<p>&#8220;An interesting feature of Gavr&#8217; Inis is its remarkable
resemblance to the New Grange tumulus at Meath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page39">[39]</span>
In construction there is again a strong resemblance to
M&aelig;s-Howe, in the island of Orkney. There is also
some resemblance in smaller details.&#8221;</p>

<p>While we generally have circles in Britain without,
or with small, alignments; in Brittany we have alignments
without circles, some of them being on an enormous
scale;<a href="#Footnote8" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor8">[8]</a> thus at Menec (the place of stones) we
have eleven lines of menhirs, terminating towards the
west in a cromlech, and, notwithstanding that great
numbers have been converted to other uses, 1169
menhirs still remain, some reaching as much as 18 feet
in height.</p>

<p>The alignments of Kermario (the place of the dead)
contain 989 menhirs in ten lines. Those of Kerlescant
(the place of burning), which beginning with eleven
rows are afterwards increased to thirteen, contain altogether
579 stones and thirty-nine in the cromlech, with
some additional stones. The adoration paid these stones
yielded very slowly to Christianity. In the church
history of Brittany the <i>Cultus Lapidum</i> was denounced
in 658 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span></p>

<p>Many of the fallen menhirs in these alignments have
been restored to their upright position by the French
Government. Some of them may have been overturned
in compliance with the decree of 658 <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> above referred
to. Several of the loftier menhirs are surmounted by
crosses of stone or iron.</p>

<p>Both circles and alignments are associated with holidays
and the lighting of fires on certain days of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page40">[40]</span>
year. This custom has remained more general in Brittany
than in Britain. At Mount St. Michael, near
Carnac, the custom still prevails of lighting a large
bonfire on its summit at the time of the summer solstice;
others, kindled on prominent eminences for a
distance of twenty or thirty miles round, reply to it.
These fires are locally called &#8220;Tan Heol,&#8221; and also by a
later use, Tan St. Jean. In Scotland there was a
similar custom in the first week in May under the name
of Bel Tan, or Baal&#8217;s Fire; the synonym for summer
used by Sir Walter Scott in the &#8220;Lady of the
<span class="nowrap">Lake&#8221;:&mdash;</span></p>

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>At Kerlescant the winter solstice is celebrated by a
holiday, whilst Menec greets the summer solstice, and
Kermario the equinoxes, with festivals. Concerning
these fires and the associated customs Mr. Frazer&#8217;s
&#8220;Golden Bough&#8221; is a perfect mine of information and
should be consulted. It may simply be said here that the
May and November, and June and December fires seem
to be the most ancient. It is stated that the Balder
bale fires on Mayday Eve were recognised by the primitive
race, and I shall prove this in the sequel when
British customs are referred to. On the introduction
of Christianity the various customs were either transferred
to or reorganised in association with church
festivals; but as some of these, such as Easter, are
movable feasts, it is difficult to follow the dates.</p>

<p>Regarding both circles and alignments in the light
of the orientation theory, we may consider simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page41">[41]</span>
circles with a central stone as a collection of sight-lines
from the central stone to one or more of the
outer ones, or the interval between any two; indicating
the place of the rise or setting of either the sun
or a star on some particular day of the year, which
day, in the case of the sun, will be a new year&#8217;s
day.</p>

<p>Alignments, on the other hand, will play the same
part as the sight-lines in the circles.</p>

<p>Sometimes the sight-line may be indicated by a
menhir outside, and even at a considerable distance
from, the circle; later on tumuli replaced menhirs.</p>

<p>The dolmens have, I am convinced, been in many
cases not graves originally, but darkened observing
places whence to observe along a sight-line; this would
be best done by means of an <i>all&eacute;e couverte</i>, the predecessor
of the darkened naos at Stonehenge, shielded
by its covered trilithons.</p>

<p>In order to obtain some measurements to test the
orientation theory in Britain, I found that Stonehenge
is the ancient monument in this country which lends
itself to accurate theodolite work better than any
other. Mr. Spence&#8217;s excellent work on astronomical
lines at Stenness, where the stones, till some years ago
at all events, have been more respected than further
south, suggested a beginning there, but the distance
from London made it impossible.</p>

<p>Avebury and Stanton Drew are well known to a
great many arch&aelig;ologists; there are also other very
wonderful stone circles near Keswick and in other
parts of England; but unfortunately it is very much
more difficult to get astronomical data from these<span class="pagenum" id="Page42">[42]</span>
ancient monuments than it is in the case of Stonehenge,
one reason being that Stonehenge itself lies
high, and the horizon round it in all directions is
pretty nearly the same height, so that the important
question of the heights of the hills along the sight-line&mdash;a
matter which is fundamental from an astronomical
point of view, although it has been neglected,
so far as I can make out, by most who have made
observations on these ancient monuments&mdash;is quite a
simple one at Stonehenge. Hence it was much easier
to determine a date there than by working at any of
the other ancient remains to which I have referred.</p>

<p>In orientation generally&mdash;such orientation as has
been dealt with by Mr. Penrose and myself in Egypt
and in Greece&mdash;the question frequently was a change
in direction in the axis of a temple, or the laying
down of the axis of a temple, by means of observations
of stars. Unfortunately for us as arch&aelig;ologists, not
as astronomers, the changes of position of the stars,
owing to certain causes, chiefly the precessional movement,
are very considerable; so that if a temple
pointed to a star in one year, in two or three hundred
years it would no longer point to the same star,
but to another.</p>

<p>These star observations were requisite in order to
warn the priests about an hour before sunrise so that
they might prepare for the morning sacrifice which
always took place at the first appearance of the sun.
Hence the morning star to be visible in the dawn
must be a bright one, and the further north or south
of the sun&#8217;s rising place it rose, the more easily it
would be seen. Some stars so chosen rose not far<span class="pagenum" id="Page43">[43]</span>
from the north point of the horizon. The alignments
with small azimuths referred to in the British circles
(<a href="#Page36">p. 36</a>) I believe to be connected with the Egyptian
and Greek practice.</p>

<p>Acting on a very old tradition, some people from
Salisbury and other surrounding places go to observe
the sunrise on the longest day of the year at Stonehenge.
We therefore are perfectly justified in assuming
that it was a solar temple used for observation in
the height of midsummer. But at dawn in midsummer
in these latitudes the sky is so bright that it is not
easy to see stars even if we get up in the morning to
look for them; stars, therefore, were not in question, so
that some other principle had to be adopted, and that
was to point the temple directly to the position on the
horizon at which the sun rose on that particular day
of the year, and no other.</p>

<p>Now, if there were no change in the position of the
sun, that, of course, would go on for ever and ever;
but, fortunately for arch&aelig;ologists, there is a slight
change in the position of the sun, as there is in the
case of a star, but for a different reason; the planes
of the ecliptic and of the equator undergo a slight
change in the angle included between them. So far
as we know, that angle has been gradually getting less
for many thousands of years, so that, in the case of
Stonehenge, if we wish to determine the date, having
no stars to help us, the only thing that we can hope
to get any information from is the very slow change
of this angle; that, therefore, was the special point
which Mr. Penrose and I were anxious to study at
Stonehenge, for the reason that we seemed in a position<span class="pagenum" id="Page44">[44]</span>
to do it there more conveniently than anywhere else
in Britain.</p>

<div class="figcenter w430" id="Fig8">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8</span>.&mdash;The original tooling of the stone protected from the action of the
weather.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>But while the astronomical conditions are better at<span class="pagenum" id="Page45">[45]</span>
Stonehenge than elsewhere, the ruined state of the
monument makes accurate measurements very difficult.</p>

<p>Great age and the action of weather are responsible
for much havoc, so that very many of the stones
are now recumbent, as will be gathered from an article
by Mr. Lewis, who described the condition of the
monument in 1901, in <i>Man</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig9">

stones by Mr. Lewis in <i>Man</i>.)</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>Professor Gowland in his excavations at Stonehenge,
to which I shall refer in the sequel, found the original
tooled surface near the bottom of one of the large
sarsens which had been protected from the action of
the weather by having been buried in the ground. It
enables us to imagine the appearance of the monument
as it left the hands of the builders (<a href="#Fig8">Fig. 8</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page46">[46]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w440" id="Fig10">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 10</span>.&mdash;Copy of Hoare&#8217;s plan of 1810, showing the unbroken Vallum and
its relation with the Avenue.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>But the real destructive agent has been man himself;
savages could not have played more havoc with
the monument than the English who have visited it at
different times for different purposes. It is said the<span class="pagenum" id="Page47">[47]</span>
fall of one great stone was caused in 1620 by some
excavations, but this has been doubted; the fall of
another in 1797 was caused by gipsies digging a hole
in which to shelter, and boil their kettle; many
of the stones have been used for building walls and
bridges; masses weighing from 56 lb. downwards have
been broken off by hammers or cracked off as a result
of fires lighted by excursionists.</p>

<p>It appears that the temenos wall or vallum, which
is shown complete in Hoare&#8217;s plan of 1810, is now
broken down in many places by vehicles indiscriminately
driven over it. Indeed, its original
importance has now become so obliterated that many
do not notice it as part of the structure&mdash;that, in
fact, it bears the same relation to the interior stone
circle as the nave of St. Paul&#8217;s does to the Lady
Chapel (<a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>It is within the knowledge of all interested in arch&aelig;ology
that not long ago Sir Edmund Antrobus, the
owner of Stonehenge, advised by the famous Wiltshire
local society, the Society for the Protection of Ancient
Buildings, and the Society of Antiquaries, enclosed the
monument in order to preserve it from further wanton
destruction, and&mdash;a first step in the way of restoration&mdash;with
the skilled assistance of Prof. Gowland and
Messrs. Carruthers, Detmar Blow and Stallybrass, set
upright the most important menhir, which threatened
to fall or else break off at one of the cracks. This
menhir, the so-called &#8220;leaning stone,&#8221; once formed one
of the uprights of the trilithon the fall of the other
member of which is stated by Mr. Lewis to have
occurred before 1574. The latter, broken in two pieces,<span class="pagenum" id="Page48">[48]</span>
and the supported impost, now lie prostrate across
the altar stone.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig11">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 11</span>.&mdash;The Leaning Stone in 1901.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>This piece of work was carried out with consummate<span class="pagenum" id="Page49">[49]</span>
skill and care, and most important conclusions, as we
shall see in a subsequent chapter, were derived from
the minute inquiry into the conditions revealed in the
excavations which were necessary for the proper conduct
of the work.</p>

<p>Let us hope that we have heard the last of the
work of devastators, and even that, before long, some
of the other larger stones, now inclined or prostrate,
may be set upright.</p>

<p>Since Sir Edmund Antrobus, the present owner, has
acted on the advice of the societies I have named to
enclose the monument, with a view to guard it from
destruction and desecration, he has been assailed on
all sides. It is not a little surprising that the &#8220;unclimbable
wire fence&#8221; recommended by the societies
in question (the Bishop of Bristol being the president
of the Wiltshire society at the time) is by some regarded
as a suggestion that the property is not national,
the fact being that the nation has not bought the
property, and that it has been private property for
centuries, and treated in the way we have seen.</p>

<p>Let us hope also that before long the gaps in the
vallum may be filled up. These, as I have already
stated, take away from the meaning of an important
part of one of the most imposing monuments of the
world. In the meantime, it is comforting to know that,
thanks to what Sir Edmund Antrobus has done, no
more stones will be stolen, or broken by sledge-hammers;
that fires; that excavations such as were apparently
the prime cause of the disastrous fall of one of the
majestic trilithons in 1797; that litter, broken bottles<span class="pagenum" id="Page50">[50]</span>
and the like, with which too many British sightseers
mark their progress, besides much indecent desecration,
are things of the past.</p>

<p>If Stonehenge had been built in Italy, or France, or
Germany, it would have been in charge of the State
long ago.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">I now pass from the monument itself to a reference
to some of the traditions and historical statements
concerning it.</p>

<p>Those who are interested in these matters should
thank the Wiltshire Arch&aelig;ological and Natural History
Society, which is to be warmly congratulated on its
persistent and admirable efforts to do all in its power to
enable the whole nation to learn about the venerable
monuments of antiquity which it has practically taken
under its scientific charge. It has published two most
important volumes<a href="#Footnote9" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor9">[9]</a> dealing specially with Stonehenge,
including both its traditions and history.</p>

<p>With regard to Mr. Long&#8217;s memoir, it may be stated
that it includes important extracts from notices of
Stonehenge from the time of Henry of Huntingdon
(twelfth century) to Hoare (1812), and that all extant
information is given touching on the questions by
whom the stones were erected, whence they came, and
what was the object of the structure.</p>

<p>From Mr. Harrison&#8217;s more recently published bibliography,
no reference to Stonehenge by any ancient
author, no letter to the <i>Times</i> for the last twenty<span class="pagenum" id="Page51">[51]</span>
years dealing with any question touching the monuments,
seems to be omitted.</p>

<p>It is very sad to read, both in Mr. Long&#8217;s volume
and the bibliography, of the devastation which has
been allowed to go on for so many years and of the
various forms it has taken.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">As almost the whole of the notes which follow deal
with the assumption of Stonehenge having been a solar
temple, a short reference to the earliest statements concerning
this view is desirable; and, again, as the approximate
date arrived at by Mr. Penrose and myself
in 1901 is an early one, a few words may be added indicating
the presence in Britain at that time of a race
of men capable of designing and executing such work.
I quote from the paper communicated by Mr. Penrose
and myself to the Royal <span class="nowrap">Society:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;As to the first point, Diodorus Siculus (ii., 47, ed.
Didot, p. 116) has preserved a statement of Hecat&aelig;us
in which Stonehenge alone can by any probability be
referred to.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;We think that no one will consider it foreign to
our subject to say a word respecting the Hyperboreans.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Amongst the writers who have occupied themselves
with the mythology of the ancients, Hecat&aelig;us and some
others tell us that opposite the land of the Celts [&#7953;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#953;&#962;
&#7937;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#960;&#949;&#961;&#945;&#957; &#964;&#951;&#962;
&#922;&#949;&#955;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#951;&#962; &#964;&#959;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;] there exists in the Ocean
an island not smaller than Sicily, and which, situated
under the constellation of The Bear, is inhabited by the
Hyperboreans; so called because they live beyond the
point from which the North wind blows.... If one
may believe the same mythology, Latona was born in<span class="pagenum" id="Page52">[52]</span>
this island, and for that reason the inhabitants honour
Apollo more than any other deity. A sacred enclosure
[&#957;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#957;] is dedicated to him in the island, as well as
a magnificent circular temple adorned with many rich
offerings.... The Hyperboreans are in general very
friendly to the Greeks.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Hecat&aelig;us above referred to was probably
Hecat&aelig;us of Abdera, in Thrace, fourth century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>;
a friend of Alexander the Great. This Hecat&aelig;us is
said to have written a history of the Hyperboreans:
that it was Hecat&aelig;us of Miletus, an historian of the
sixth century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, is less likely.</p>

<p>&#8220;As to the second point, although we cannot go so
far back in evidence of the power and civilisation of
the Britons, there is an argument of some value to
be drawn from the fine character of the coinage issued
by British kings early in the second century <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and
from the statement of Julius C&aelig;sar (&#8216;De Bello Gallico,&#8217;
vi., c. 14) that in the schools of the Druids the subjects
taught included the movements of the stars, the size
of the earth, and the nature of things (multa pr&aelig;terea
de sideribus et eorum motu, de mundi magnitudine,
de rerum natura, de deorum immortalium vi ac potestate
disputant et juventuti tradunt).</p>

<p>&#8220;Studies of such a character seem quite consistent
with, and to demand, a long antecedent period of
civilisation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Henry of Huntingdon is the first English writer to
refer to Stonehenge, which he calls Stanenges. Geoffrey
of Monmouth (1138) and Giraldus Cambrensis come next.</p>

<p>In 1771, Dr. John Smith, in a work entitled &#8220;Choir
Gawr, the Grand Orrery of the Ancient Druids, called<span class="pagenum" id="Page53">[53]</span>
Stonehenge, Astronomically Explained, and proved to
be a Temple for Observing the Motions of the Heavenly
Bodies,&#8221; wrote as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;From many and repeated visits, I conceived it to
be an astronomical temple; and from what I could
recollect to have read of it, no author had as yet investigated
its uses. Without an instrument or any
assistance whatever, but White&#8217;s &#8216;Ephemeris,&#8217; I began
my survey. I suspected the stone called <i>The Friar&#8217;s
Heel</i> to be the index that would disclose the uses of
this structure; nor was I deceived. This stone stands
in a right line with the centre of the temple, pointing
to the north-east. I first drew a circle round the
vallum of the ditch and divided it into 360 equal
parts; and then a right line through the body of the
temple to the Friar&#8217;s Heel; at the intersection of these
lines I reckoned the sun&#8217;s greatest amplitude at the
summer solstice, in this latitude, to be about 60 degrees,
and fixed the eastern points accordingly. Pursuing
this plan, I soon discovered the uses of all the detached
stones, as well as those that formed the body of the
temple.&#8221;</p>

<p>With regard to this &#8220;Choir Gawr,&#8221; translated Chorea
Gigantum, Leland&#8217;s opinion is quoted (Long, p. 51)
that we should read Choir vawr, the equivalent of
which is Chorea nobilis or magna.<a href="#Footnote10" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor10">[10]</a></p>

<p>In spite of Inigo Jones&#8217;s (1600) dictum that Stonehenge
was of Roman origin, Stukeley came to the conclusion
in 1723 that the Druids were responsible for<span class="pagenum" id="Page54">[54]</span>
its building; and Halley, who visited it in 1720&mdash;probably
with Stukeley&mdash;concluded from the weathering
of the stones that it was at least 3000 years old; if
he only had taken his theodolite with him, how much
his interest in the monument would have been increased!</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER VI</span><br />
<span class="h2name">GENERAL ARCHITECTURE OF STONEHENGE</span></h2>

<p>Although I have before hinted that the astronomical
use of the Egyptian temples and British circles
was the same, there is at first sight a vast difference
in the general plan of structure.</p>

<p>This has chiefly depended upon the fact that the
riches and population of ancient Egypt were so great
that that people could afford to build a temple to a
particular star, or to the sun&#8217;s position on any particular
day of the year. The temple axis along the line
pointing to the celestial body involved, then became
the chief feature, and tens of years were spent in
lengthening, constricting and embellishing it.</p>

<div class="figcenter w320" id="Fig12">

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig. 12</span>.&mdash;The axis of the Temple of Karnak, looking south-east, from outside
the north-west pylon (from a photograph by the author).</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>From one end of an Egyptian temple to the other
we find the axis marked out by narrow apertures in
the various pylons, and many walls with doors crossing
the axis. There are seventeen or eighteen of these
apertures in the solar temple of Amen-R&#257; at Karnak,
limiting the light which falls into the Holy of Holies
or Sanctuary. This construction gives one a very
definite impression that every part of the temple was
built to subserve a special object, viz., to limit the
sunlight which fell on its front into a narrow beam,<span class="pagenum" id="Page56">[56]</span>
and to carry it to the other extremity of the temple&mdash;into
the sanctuary, where the high priest performed
his functions. The sanctuary was always blocked.
There is no case in which the beam of light can pass
absolutely through a temple (<a href="#Fig12">Figs. 12</a> and <a href="#Fig13">13</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page57">[57]</span></p>

axis, the sanctuary at the closed end, and the temple at right angles.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page58">[58]</span></p>

<p>In Britain the case was different, there was neither
skill nor workers sufficient to erect such stately piles,
and as a consequence one structure had to do the
work of several and it had to be done in the most
economical way. Hence the circle with the observer
at the centre and practically a temple axis in every
direction among which could be chosen the chief directions
required, each alignment being defined by stones,
more or less distant, or openings in the circle itself.</p>

<p>Now for some particulars with regard to those parts
of Stonehenge which lend themselves to the inquiry.</p>

<p>The main architecture of Stonehenge consisted of an
external circle of about 100 feet in diameter, composed
of thirty large upright stones, named sarsens, connected
by continuous lintels. The upright stones formerly
stood 14 feet above the surface of the ground. They
have nobs or tenons on the top which fit into mortice
holes in the lintels. Within this peristyle there was
originally an inner structure of ten still larger upright
stones, arranged in the shape of a horseshoe, formed
by five isolated trilithons which rose progressively
from N.E. to S.W., the loftiest stones being 25 feet
above the ground. About one-half of these uprights
have fallen, and a still greater number of the imposts
which they originally carried.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig14">

<img src="images/illo071.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="436" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 14</span>.&mdash;One of the remaining Trilithons.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>There is also another circle of smaller upright stones,
respecting which the only point requiring notice now is
that none of them would have interrupted the line of
the axis of the avenue. The circular temple was also<span class="pagenum" id="Page59">[59]</span>
surrounded by the earthen bank, shown in <a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>, of
about 300 feet in diameter, interrupted towards the
north-east by receiving into itself the banks forming the
avenue before mentioned, which is about 50 feet across.<span class="pagenum" id="Page60">[60]</span>
Within this avenue, no doubt an old <i>via sacra</i>, and
looking north-east from the centre of the temple, at
about 250 feet distance and considerably to the right
hand of the axis, stands an isolated stone, which from
a medi&aelig;val legend has been named the Friar&#8217;s Heel.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig15">

<img src="images/illo072.png" alt="" width="600" height="594" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 15</span>.&mdash;General plan; the outer circle, naos and avenue of Stonehenge.<br />
<i>F.H.</i> = Friar&#8217;s Heel.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>The axis passes very nearly centrally through an
intercolumniation (so to call it) between two uprights
of the external circle and between the uprights of the
westernmost trilithon as it originally stood. Of this
trilithon the southernmost upright with the lintel
stone fell in 1620, but the companion survived as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page61">[61]</span>
leaning stone which formed a conspicuous and picturesque
object for many years, but happily now restored
to its original more dignified and safer condition of
vertically. The inclination of this stone, however, took
place in the direction of the axis of the avenue, and
as the distance between it and its original companion
is known both by the analogy of the two perfect trilithons
and by the measure of the mortice holes on
the lintel they formerly supported, we obtain by bisection
the distance, 11 inches, from its edge, of a point
in the continuation of the central axis of the avenue
and temple.</p>

<p>The banks which form the avenue have suffered much
degradation. It appears from Sir Richard Colt Hoare&#8217;s
account that at the beginning of the last century they
were distinguishable for a much greater distance than
at present, but they are still discernible, especially on
the northern side, for more than 1300 feet from the
centre of the temple, and particularly the line of the
bottom of the ditch from which the earth was taken
to form the bank, and which runs parallel to it.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER VII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AT STONEHENGE IN
1901<a href="#Footnote11" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor11">[11]</a></span></h2>

<p>An investigation was undertaken by Mr. Penrose and
myself in the spring of 1901, as a sequel to analogous
work in Egypt and Greece, with a view to determine
whether the orientation theory could throw any light
upon the date of the foundation of Stonehenge, concerning
which authorities vary in their estimates by
some thousands of years. Ours was not the first attempt
to obtain the date of Stonehenge by means of astronomical
considerations. In Mr. Godfrey Higgins&#8217; work<a href="#Footnote12" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor12">[12]</a>
he refers to a method of attack connected with precession.
This furnished him with the date 4000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>More recently, Prof. W. M. Flinders Petrie,<a href="#Footnote13" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor13">[13]</a> whose
plan of the stones is a valuable contribution to the
study of Stonehenge, was led by his measures of the
orientation to a date very greatly in the opposite
direction, but, owing to an error in his application of
the change of obliquity, clearly a mistaken one.</p>

<p>The chief astronomical evidence in favour of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page63">[63]</span>
solar temple theory lies in the fact that the &#8220;avenue,&#8221;
as it is called, formed by two ancient earthen banks,
extends for a considerable distance from the structure,
in the general direction of the sunrise at the summer
solstice, precisely in the same way as in Egypt a long
avenue of sphinxes indicates the principal outlook of a
temple.</p>

<p>These earthen banks defining the avenue do not exist
alone. As will be seen from the sketch plan (<a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>),
there is a general common line of direction for the avenue
and the principal axis of the structure; and the general
design of the building, together with the position and
shape of the naos, indicates a close connection of the
whole temple structure with the direction of the avenue.
There may have been other pylon and screen equivalents
as in other ancient temples, which have disappeared,
the object being to confine the illumination
to a small part of the naos. There can be little doubt,
also, that the temple was originally roofed in, and
that the sun&#8217;s first ray, suddenly shining into the
darkness, formed a fundamental part of the cultus.</p>

<p>With regard to the question of the roof, however,
the above suggestion, I now find, is not new, the view
having been held by no less an authority than Dr.
Thurnham, who apparently was led to it by the representations
of the Scandinavian temples as covered and
enclosed structures.</p>

<p>Since the actual observation of sunrise was doubtless
made within the sanctuary itself, we seem justified in
taking the orientation of the axis to be the same as
that of the avenue, and since in the present state of
the S.W. trilithon the direction of the avenue can<span class="pagenum" id="Page64">[64]</span>
probably be determined with greater accuracy than
that of the temple axis itself, the estimate of date
must be based upon the orientation of the avenue.
Further evidence will be given, however, to show that
the direction of the axis of the temple, so far as it
can now be determined, is sufficiently accordant with
the direction of the avenue.</p>

<p>The orientation of this avenue may be examined upon
the same principles that have been found successful in
the case of Greek and Egyptian temples&mdash;that is, on
the assumption that Stonehenge was a solar temple, and
that the greatest function took place at sunrise on the
longest day of the year. This not only had a religious
motive; it had also the economic value of marking
officially and distinctly that time of the year and the
beginning of an annual period.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, possible that the present structure may
have had other capabilities, such as being connected
with the May year, the equinoxes or the winter solstice;
but it is with its uses at the summer solstice alone
that we now deal.</p>

<p>There is a difference in treatment between the observations
required for Stonehenge and those which are
available for Greek or Egyptian solar temples. In the
case of the latter, the effect of the precession of the
equinoxes upon the stars, which as warning clock stars
were almost invariably connected with those temples,
offers the best measure of the dates of foundation; but
in Britain, owing to the brightness of the dawn at the
summer solstice, such a star could not have been
employed, so that we can rely only on the secular
change of the obliquity as affecting the azimuth of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page65">[65]</span>
point of sunrise. This requires the measurements to be
taken with very great precision, and as the azimuth
of the place of sunrise varies with the latitude, and as
a datum point on the horizon in a known position was
also required, Colonel Johnston, R.E., the Director-General
of the Ordnance Survey, was asked for and
obligingly supplied the following particulars:</p>

<p>The real point was to determine the direction of the
so-called avenue. Measurements taken from the line
of the bottom of the ditch assisted materially those
taken from the crown of the bank itself. With this
help and by using the southern bank and ditch whenever
it admitted of recognition, a fair estimate of the
central line could be arrived at. To verify this, two
pegs were placed at points 140 feet apart along the
line near the commencement of the avenue, and four
others at distances averaging 100 feet apart nearer
the further recognisable extremity, and their directions
were measured with the theodolite, independently
by two observers, the reference point being Salisbury
Spire, of which the exact bearing had been communicated
by Colonel Johnston.</p>

<p>This bearing was also measured locally by observations
of the Sun and of Polaris, the mean of
which differed by less than 20&#8243; from the Ordnance
value. The resulting observations gave for the axis
of the avenue nearest the commencement an azimuth
of 49&deg; 38&#8242; 48&#8243;, and for that of the more distant part<span class="pagenum" id="Page66">[66]</span>
49&deg; 32&#8242; 54&#8243;. The mean of these two lines drawn from
the central interval of the great trilithon, already referred
to, passes between two of the sarsens of the
exterior circle, which have an opening of about 4 feet,
within a few inches of their middle point, the deviation
being northwards. This may be considered to
prove the close coincidence of the original axis of the
temple with the direction of the avenue.</p>

<p>This value of the azimuth, the mean of which is
49&deg; 35&#8242; 51&#8243;, is confirmed by the information, also
supplied from the Ordnance Survey, that from the
centre of the temple, the bearing to the N.E. of the
principal bench mark on a hill, about 8 miles distant,
the bench mark being very near a well-known ancient
fortified British encampment named Silbury or Sidbury,
is 49&deg; 34&#8242; 18&#8243;; and that the same line continued through
Stonehenge, to the south-west, strikes another ancient
fortification, namely, Grovely Castle, about 6 miles
distant, and at practically the same azimuth, viz., 49&deg;
35&#8242; 51&#8243;. For the above reasons 49&deg; 34&#8242; 18&#8243; has been
adopted for the azimuth of the avenue.</p>

<p>The summer solstice sunrise in 1901 was also watched
for by Mr. Howard Payn on five successive mornings,
viz., June 21 to 25, and was successfully observed on
the last occasion. As soon as the Sun&#8217;s limb was
sufficiently above the horizon for its bisection to be
well measured, it was found to be 8&#8242; 40&#8243; northwards
of the peak of the Friar&#8217;s Heel, which was used as
the reference point; the altitude of the horizon being
35&#8242; 48&#8243;. The azimuth of this peak from the point of
observation had been previously ascertained to be 50&deg;
39&#8242; 5&#8243;, giving for that of the Sun when measured, 50&deg;<span class="pagenum" id="Page67">[67]</span>
30&#8242; 25&#8243;; by calculation that of the Sun, with the
limb 2&#8242; above the horizon, should be 50&deg; 30&#8242; 54&#8243;.
This observation was therefore completely in accordance
with the results which had been obtained otherwise.</p>

<p>The time which would elapse between geometrical
sunrise, that is, with the upper limb tangential with the
horizon, and that which is here supposed, would be about
17 seconds, and the difference of azimuth would be 3&#8242; 15&#8243;.</p>

<p>The remaining point was to find what value should be
given to the Sun&#8217;s declination when it appeared showing
itself 2&#8242; above the horizon, the azimuth being 49&deg; 34&#8242; 18&#8243;.</p>

<p>The data obtained for the determination of the
required epoch were as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1.) The elevation of the local horizon at the sunrise
point seen by a man standing between the uprights of the
great trilithon (a distance of about 8000 feet) is about
35&#8242; 30&#8243;, and 2&#8242; additional for Sun&#8217;s upper limb makes
37&#8242; 30&#8243;.</p>

<p>(2.) -Refraction + parallax, 27&#8242; 20&#8243;.</p>

<p>(3.) Sun&#8217;s semi-diameter, allowance being made for
greater eccentricity than at present, 15&#8242; 45&#8243;.</p>

<p>(4.) Sun&#8217;s azimuth, 49&deg; 34&#8242; 18&#8243;, and N. latitude,
51&deg; 10&#8242; 42&#8243;.</p>

<p>From the above data the Sun&#8217;s declination works out
23&deg; 54&#8242; 30&#8243; N., and by Stockwell&#8217;s tables of the obliquity,
which are based upon modern determinations of the
elements of the solar system,<a href="#Footnote14" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor14">[14]</a> the date is found to be
1680 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It is to be understood that on account of the slight
uncertainty as to the original line of observation and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page68">[68]</span>
very slow rate of change in the obliquity of the ecliptic,
the date thus derived may possibly be in error by 200
years more or less; this gives us a date of construction
lying between say 1900 and 1500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In this investigation the so-called Friar&#8217;s Heel was used
only as a convenient point for reference and verification
in measurement, and no theory was formed as to its
purpose. It is placed at some distance, as before
mentioned, to the south of the axis of the avenue, so that
at the date arrived at for the erection of the temple the
Sun must have completely risen before it was vertically
over the summit of the stone. It may be remarked,
further, that more than 500 years must yet elapse
before such a coincidence can take place at the beginning
of sunrise.</p>

<p>In an <a href="#Page325">Appendix</a> certain details of the observations are
given.</p>

<p>In the next chapter I propose to show that an independent
arch&aelig;ological inquiry carried out, in a most
complete and admirable way, just after Mr. Penrose
and myself had obtained our conclusion, entirely corroborates
the date at which we had arrived.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER VIII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">ARCH&AElig;OLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS AT STONEHENGE, 1901</span></h2>

<p>Soon after Mr. Penrose and myself had made our
astronomical survey of Stonehenge in 1901, some arch&aelig;ological
results of the highest importance were obtained
by Professor Gowland. The operations which secured
them were designed and carried out in order to re-erect
the leaning stone which threatened to fall, a piece of work
recommended to Sir Edmund Antrobus by the Society
of Antiquaries of London and other learned bodies, and
conducted at his desire and expense.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page70">[70]</span></p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page71">[71]</span></p>

<p>They were necessarily on a large scale, for the great
monolith, &#8220;the leaning stone,&#8221; is the largest in England,
the Rudston monolith excepted. It stood behind the
altar stone, over which it leant at an angle of 65 degrees,
resting at one point against a small stone of syenite. Half-way
up it had a fracture one-third across it; the weight
of stone above this fracture was a dangerous strain on it,
so that both powerful machinery and great care and
precautions had to be used. Professor Gowland was
charged by the Society of Antiquaries with the conduct
of the excavations necessary in the work. The engineering
operations were planned by Mr. Carruthers, and
Mr. Detmar Blow was responsible for the local superintendence.
Mr. Blow thus describes the arrangements
(<i>Journal</i> Institute of British Architects, 3rd series, ix.,
January, <span class="nowrap">1902):&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page72">[72]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;A strong cradle of 12-inch square baulks of timber
was bolted round the stone, with packing and felt, to
prevent any marking of the stone. To the cradle were
fixed two 1-inch steel eyebolts to receive the blocks for
two six-folds of 6-inch ropes. These were secured and
wound on to two strong winches fifty feet away, with four
men at each winch. When the ropes were thoroughly
tight, the first excavation was made as the stone was
raised on its west side.&#8221;</p>

<p>The method employed by Professor Gowland in the
excavation should be a model for all future work of the
kind.</p>

<p>Above each space to be excavated was placed a frame
of wood, bearing on its long sides the letters A to H,
and on its short sides the letters R M L, each letter being
on a line one foot distant from the next. By this means
the area to be excavated was divided into squares each
having the dimension of a square foot. A long rod
divided into 6-inch spaces, numbered from 1 to 16, was
also provided for indicating the depth from the datum
line of anything found. In this way a letter on the long
sides of the frame, together with one on the short sides,
and a number on the vertical rod, indicated the position
of any object found in any part of the excavation.</p>

<p>Excavations were necessary because to secure the stone
for the future the whole of the adjacent soil had to be
removed down to the rock level, so that it could be
replaced by concrete.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page74">[74]</span></p>

<p>All results were registered by Professor Gowland in
relation to a datum line 337&middot;4 feet above sea level. The
material was removed in buckets, and carefully sifted
through a series of sieves 1-inch, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>-inch, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub>-inch, and
<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>-inch mesh, in order that the smallest object might
not be overlooked.</p>

<p>From the exhaustive account of his work given by
Professor Gowland to the Society of Antiquaries (<i>Archaeologia</i>,
lviii.), I gather three results of the highest importance
from the point of view I am considering. These
were, first, the finding of an enormous number of implements;
secondly, the disposition and relative quantities
of the chippings of the sarsen and blue stones; and
thirdly, the discovery of the method by which the stones
were originally erected.</p>

<p>I will take the implements first. This, in a condensed
form, is what Professor Gowland says about
<span class="nowrap">them:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>More than a hundred flint implements were found,
and the greater number occurred in the stratum of chalk
rubble which either directly overlaid or was on a level
with the bed rock. They may all be arranged generally
in the following <span class="nowrap">classes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Class I.</i>&mdash;Axes roughly chipped and of rude forms,
but having well-defined, more or less sharp cutting edges.</p>

<p><i>Class II.</i>&mdash;Hammerstones, with more or less well-chipped,
sharp curved edges. Most may be correctly
termed hammer-axes. They are chipped to an edge at
one end, but at the other are broad and thick, and in
many examples terminated there by a more or less flat
surface. In some the natural coating of the flint is left
untouched at the thick end.</p>

<p><i>Class III.</i>&mdash;Hammerstones, more or less rounded.
Some specimens appear to have once had distinct working
edges, but they are now much blunted and battered
by use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page75">[75]</span></p>

<p>In addition to the above flint implements were found
about thirty hammerstones, consisting of large pebbles
or small boulders of the hard quartzite variety of sarsen.
Some have been roughly broken into convenient forms
for holding in the hand, whilst a few have been rudely
trimmed into more regular shapes. They vary in
weight from about a pound up to six and a half
pounds. To these we have to add mauls, a more
remarkable kind of hammerstone than those just
enumerated. They are ponderous boulders of the quartzite
variety of sarsen with their broadest sides more or
less flat. Their weights range from about 40 lb. to
64 lb.</p>

<p>How came these flints and stones where they were
found? Prof. Gowland gives an answer which everybody
will accept. The implements must be regarded
as the discarded tools of the builders of Stonehenge,
dumped down into the holes as they became unfit for
use, and, in fact, used to pack the monoliths as they
were erected. We read:&mdash;&#8220;Dealing with the cavity
occupied by No. 55 before its fall, the mauls were
found wedged in below the front of its base to act
together with the large blocks of sarsen as supports&#8221;
(p. 54). Nearly all bear evidence of extremely rough
usage, their edges being jagged and broken, just as
we should expect to find after such rough employment.
We evidently have to deal with builders doing
their work in the Stone and not in the Bronze age.
But was the age Pal&aelig;olithic or Neolithic?</p>

<p>Prof. Gowland <span class="nowrap">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps the most striking features of the flint
implements is their extreme rudeness, and that there<span class="pagenum" id="Page76">[76]</span>
is not a single ground or polished specimen among
them. This, at first sight and without due consideration,
might be taken to indicate an extremely remote
age. But in this connection it must be borne in mind
that in the building of such a stupendous structure as
Stonehenge, the tools required must have been numbered
by thousands. The work, too, was of the
roughest character, and for such only rude tools were
required. The highly finished and polished implements
which we are accustomed to consider, and rightly so,
as characteristic of Neolithic man, would find no place
in such work. They required too much labour and time
for their manufacture, and, when made, could not have
been more effective than the hammer-axes and hammerstones
found in the excavations, which could be so
easily fashioned by merely rudely shaping the natural
flints, with which the district abounds, by a few well
directed blows of a sarsen pebble.&#8221;</p>

<p>On this ground Prof. Gowland is of opinion that,
notwithstanding their rudeness, they may be legitimately
ascribed to the Neolithic age, and, it may be,
near its termination, that is, before the Bronze age, the
commencement of which has been placed at 1400 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
by Sir John Evans for Britain, though he is inclined
to think that estimate too low, and 2000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> by
Montelius for Italy.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page78">[78]</span></p>

<p>Prof. Gowland guardedly <span class="nowrap">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The occurrence of stone tools does not alone prove
with absolute certainty that Stonehenge belongs to the
Neolithic age, although it affords a strong presumption
in favour of that view. But, and this is important,
had bronze been in general or even moderately extensive
use when the stones were set up, it is in the
highest degree probable that some implement of that
metal would have been lost within the area of the
excavations, and if so lost, it would certainly have
been found together with the stone tools. Further, the
employment of deer&#8217;s horn picks for the extensive excavations
made in the chalk around the base of the
monoliths also tends to support the view that bronze
implements cannot have been in common use. If they
had it would seem not unreasonable to assume that
they would have been employed, as they would have
been so much more effective for such work than the
picks of deer&#8217;s horn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Again, the chippings of the stones of Stonehenge in
two of the Bronze age barrows<a href="#Footnote15" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor15">[15]</a> in its neighbourhood
show that it is of earlier date than they.&#8221;</p>

<p>And <span class="nowrap">finally:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;In my opinion, the date when copper or bronze
was first known in Britain is a very remote one, as
no country in the world presented greater facilities for
their discovery. The beginning of their application to
practical uses should, I think, be placed at least as far
back as 1800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and that date I am inclined to give,
until further evidence is forthcoming, as the approximate
date of the erection of Stonehenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the date arrived at by Mr. Penrose and myself
on astronomical grounds was about 1700 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> It is not
a little remarkable that independent astronomical and
arch&aelig;ological inquiries conducted in the same year<span class="pagenum" id="Page79">[79]</span>
should have come so nearly to the same conclusion. If
a general agreement be arrived at regarding it, we have
a firm basis for the study of other similar ancient
monuments in this country.</p>

<p>I have previously in this book referred to the fact
that the trilithons of the naos and the stones of the
outer circle are all built up of so-called &#8220;sarsen&#8221;
stones. To describe their geological character, I cannot
do better than quote, from Mr. Cunnington&#8217;s &#8220;Geology
of Stonehenge,&#8221;<a href="#Footnote16" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor16">[16]</a> their origin according to Prestwich.</p>

<p>&#8220;Among the <i>Lower Tertiaries</i> (the Eocene of Sir
Charles Lyell) are certain sands and mottled clays,
named by Mr. Prestwich the Woolwich and Reading
beds, from their being largely developed at these
places, and from these he proves the sarsens to have
been derived; although they are seldom found <i>in situ</i>,
owing to the destruction of the stratum to which they
belonged. They are large <i>masses of sand concreted
together</i> by a siliceous cement, and when the looser
portions of the stratum were washed away, the blocks
of sandy rocks were left scattered over the surface of
the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;At Standen, near Hungerford, large masses of sarsen
are found, consisting almost <i>entirely</i> of flints, formed
into conglomerate with the sand. Flints are also
common in some of the large stones forming the ancient
temple of Avebury.</p>

<p>&#8220;The abundance of these remains, especially in some
of the valleys of North Wilts, is very remarkable. Few
persons who have not seen them can form an adequate<span class="pagenum" id="Page80">[80]</span>
idea of the extraordinary scene presented to the eye of
the spectator, who standing on the brow of one of the
hills near Clatford, sees stretching for miles before him,
countless numbers of these enormous stones, occupying
the middle of the valley, and winding like a mighty
stream towards the south.&#8221;</p>

<p>These stones, then, may be regarded as closely
associated with the local geology.</p>

<p>The exact nature of the stones, called &#8220;blue stones,&#8221;
can best be gathered from a valuable &#8220;Note&#8221; by Prof.
Judd which accompanies Prof. Gowland&#8217;s paper. These
blue stones are entirely unconnected with the local
geology; they must, therefore, represent boulders of the
Glacial drift, or they must have been brought by man,
from distant localities. Prof. Judd inclines to the first
opinion.</p>

<p>The distinction between these two kinds of stone are
well shown by Prof. <span class="nowrap">Gowland:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The large monoliths of the outer circle, and the
trilithons of the horse-shoe are all sarsens. [See general
plan, <a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>.] These sarsens in their composition are
sandstones, consisting of quartz-sand, either fine or
coarse, occasionally mixed with pebbles and angular
bits of flint, all more or less firmly cemented together
with silica. They are the relics of the concretionary
masses which had become consolidated in the sandstone
beds that once overlaid the chalk of the district, and had
resisted the destructive agencies by which the softer
parts of the beds were removed in geological times.
They range in structure from a granular rock resembling
loaf sugar in internal appearance to one of<span class="pagenum" id="Page81">[81]</span>
great compactness similar to and sometimes passing into
quartzite.</p>

<p>&#8220;The monoliths and trilithons all consist of the
granular rock. The examples of the compact quartzite
variety, of which many were found in the excavations,
were almost without exception either hammerstones that
had been used in shaping and dressing the monoliths,
or fragments which had been broken from off them in
these operations.</p>

<p>&#8220;The small monoliths, the so-called &#8216;blue stones,&#8217;
which form the inner circle and the inner horse-shoe,
are, with the undermentioned exceptions, all of diabase
more or less porphyritic. Two are porphyrite (formerly
known as felstone or hornstone). Two are argillaceous
sandstone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. William Cunnington, in his valuable paper,
&#8216;Stonehenge Notes,&#8217; records the discovery of two stumps
of &#8216;blue stones&#8217; now covered by the turf. One of these
lies in the inner horseshoe between Nos. 61 and 62,
and 9 feet distant from the latter. It is diabase. The
other is in the inner circle between Nos. 32 and 33,
10 feet from the former, and consists of a soft calcareous
altered tuff, afterwards designated for the sake of brevity
fissile rock.</p>

<p>&#8220;The altar stone is of micaceous sandstone.&#8221;</p>

<p>I now come to the second point, to which I shall
return in the next chapter.</p>

<p>In studying the material obtained from the excavations,
it was found in almost every case that the
number of chippings and fragments of blue stone largely
exceeded that of the sarsens; more than this, diabase<span class="pagenum" id="Page82">[82]</span>
(blue stone) and sarsen were found together in the layer
overlying the solid chalk (p. 15). Chippings of diabase
were the most abundant, but there were few large
pieces of it. Sarsen, on the other hand, occurred most
abundantly in lumps (p. 20); very few small chips of
sarsen were found (p. 42). Hence Prof. Gowland is of
opinion that the sarsen blocks were roughly hewn where
they were found (p. 40); the local tooling, executed
with the small quartzite hammers and mauls, would
produce not chips but dust.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page83">[83]</span></p>

<p>Finally, I reach the third point of importance from
the present standpoint; the excavations produced clear
evidence touching the mode of erection. Prof. Gowland&#8217;s
memoir deals only with the leaning stone, but I take
it for granted that the same method was employed
throughout: the method was this.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig21">

<img src="images/illo095.png" alt="" width="600" height="370" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 21</span>.&mdash;Face of rock against which a stone was made to rest.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>(1) The ground in the site a stone was to occupy was
removed, the chalk rock being cut into in such a manner
as to leave a ledge, on which the base of the stone
was to rest, <i>and a perpendicular face rising from it,
against which as a buttress</i> one side would bear when
set up. From the bottom of this hole an inclined plane
was cut to the surface down which the monolith which<span class="pagenum" id="Page84">[84]</span>
had already been dressed was slid until its base rested
on the ledge.</p>

<p>(2) It was then gradually raised into a vertical position
by means first of levers and afterwards of ropes.
The levers would be long trunks of trees, to one end
of which a number of ropes was attached (this method
is still employed in Japan); so that the weights and
pulling force of many men might be exerted on them.
The stronger ropes were probably of hide or hair, but
others of straw, or of withes of hazel or willow, may
have been in use for minor purposes.</p>

<p>(3) As the stone was raised, it was packed up with
logs of timber and probably also with blocks of stone
placed beneath it.</p>

<p>(4) After its upper end had reached a certain elevation,
ropes were attached to it, and it was then hauled
by numerous men into a vertical position, <i>so that its
back rested against the perpendicular face of the chalk
which had been prepared for it</i>. During this part
of the operation, struts of timber would probably be
placed against its sides to guard against slip, a precaution
taken when the leaning stone was raised and
until the foundation was properly set.</p>

<p>As regards the raising of the lintels, and imposts,
and the placing of them on the tops of the uprights,
there would be even less difficulty than in the erection
of the uprights themselves.</p>

<div class="figcenter w440" id="Fig22">

<img src="images/illo097.jpg" alt="" width="433" height="600" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 22</span>.&mdash;The leaning stone upright before the struts were removed.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>It could be easily effected by the simple method
practised in Japan for placing heavy blocks of stone in
position. The stone, when lying on the ground, would
be raised a little at one end by means of long wooden
levers. A packing of logs would then be placed under<span class="pagenum" id="Page85">[85]</span>
the end so raised, the other extremity of the stone
would be similarly raised and packed, and the raising
and packing at alternate ends would be continued
until the block had gradually reached the height of
the uprights. It would then be simply pushed forward
by levers until it rested upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page86">[86]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig23">

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page87">[87]</span></p>

<p>It is not often that an engineering operation has
been made so subservient to the interests of science
as the one we have dealt with in this chapter. It is
satisfactory to know not only that much new knowledge
has been acquired by Professor Gowland and his
coadjutors, but that the famous leaning stone has now
been set upright in such fashion that it will remain
upright for hundreds of years. May the other leaning
stones soon receive the same treatment.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER IX</span><br />
<span class="h2name">WAS THERE AN EARLIER CIRCLE?</span></h2>

<p>When we come to examine Stonehenge carefully in
relation to the orientation theory, it soon becomes clear
that its outer circle of upright stones with lintels, and
the inner naos, built of trilithons, oriented in the line
of the &#8220;avenue&#8221; and the summer solstice sunrise, are
not the only things to be considered. These stones,
all composed of sarsen, which, be it remarked, have
been trimmed and tooled, are not alone in question.
We <span class="nowrap">have:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) An interior circle broken in many places, and
other stones near the naos, composed of stones, &#8220;blue
stones,&#8221; which, as we have seen, are of an entirely
different origin and composition.</p>

<p>(2) Two smaller <i>untrimmed</i> sarsen stones lying near
the vallum, <i>not</i> at the same distance from it, the line
joining them passing nearly, but not quite, through
the centre of the sarsen circle. The amplitude of the
line joining them is approximately 26&deg; S. of E. and
26&deg; N. of W. Of these stones, the stump of the N.W.
one is situated 22 feet from the top of the vallum
according to the Ordnance plan. The S.E. stone has
fallen, but according to careful observations and<span class="pagenum" id="Page89">[89]</span>
measurements by Mr. Penrose, when erect its centre was
14 feet from the top of the vallum. The centre of the
line joining the stones is therefore about 4 feet to the
S.E. of the axis of the present circles, which, it may be<span class="pagenum" id="Page90">[90]</span>
stated, passes 3 feet to the N.W. of the N.W. edge
of the Friar&#8217;s Heel (see <a href="#Fig24">Fig. 24</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig24">

<span class="smcapall">B</span>, S.E. stone; <span class="smcapall">C</span>, Friar&#8217;s Heel;
<span class="smcapall">D</span>, Slaughter stone.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>There are besides these two large <i>untrimmed</i> sarsen
stones, one standing some distance outside the vallum,
one recumbent lying on the vallum; both nearly, but
not quite, in the sunrise line as viewed from the centre
of the sarsen circle. These are termed the &#8220;Friar&#8217;s
Heel&#8221; and &#8220;Slaughter Stone&#8221; respectively.</p>

<p>I will deal with (1) first, and begin by another
quotation from Mr. Cunnington, who displayed great
acumen in dealing with the smaller stones not sarsens.</p>

<p>&#8220;The most important consideration connected with
the smaller stones, and one which in its arch&aelig;ological
bearing has been too much overlooked, is the fact of
their having been brought from a great distance. I
expressed an opinion on this subject in a lecture
delivered at Devizes more than eighteen years ago, and
I have been increasingly impressed with it since. I
believe that these stones would not have been brought
from such a distance to a spot where an abundance of
building stones equally suitable in every respect already
existed, unless some special or religious value had been
attached to them. This goes far to prove that Stonehenge
was <i>originally a temple</i>, and neither a monument
raised to the memory of the dead, nor an astronomical
calendar or almanac.</p>

<p>&#8220;It has been suggested that they were Danams, or
the offerings of successive votaries. Would there in
such case have been such uniformity of design, or would
they have been all alike of foreign materials? I would
make one remark about the small impost of a trilithon
of syenite, now lying prostrate within the circle. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page91">[91]</span>
writer has followed another in taking it for granted
that there must have been a second, corresponding with
it, on the opposite side. Of this there is neither proof
nor record, not a trace of one having been seen by any
person who has written on the subject. This small
impost, not being of sarsen, but syenite, must have
belonged to the original old circle; <i>it may even have
suggested to the builders of the present Stonehenge the
idea of the large imposts, and trilithons with their
tenons and mortices</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Prof. Gowland&#8217;s examination of the contents of
the holes necessarily dug in his operations, it was found
over and over again, indeed almost universally, that the
quantity of blue stone chippings was much greater than
that from the sarsen stones. While the sarsen stones
had only been worked or tooled on their surface, the
blue stones had been hewed and trimmed in extraordinary
fashion; indeed it is stated by Prof. Judd
that they had been reduced to half their original
dimensions in this process, the chippings almost equalling
the volume of the stones themselves.</p>

<p>It seems, then, that when the sarsen stones were set
up, the sarsen and blue stones were treated very differently.
This being so, the following quotation from
Prof. Judd&#8217;s &#8220;Note&#8221; is interesting (<i>Archaeologia</i>, lviii.,
p. <span class="nowrap">81):&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;I may repeat my conviction that if the prevalent
beliefs and traditions concerning Stonehenge were true,
and the &#8220;bluestone&#8221; circles were transported from some
distant locality, either as trophies of war or as the
sacred treasures of a wandering tribe, it is quite inconceivable
that they should have been hewed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page92">[92]</span>
chipped, as we now know them to have been, and reduced
in some cases to half their dimensions, <i>after having
been carried with enormous difficulty over land and
water, and over hills and valleys</i>. On the other hand, in
the glacial drift, which once probably thinly covered
the district, the glacial deposits dying out very gradually
as we proceed southwards, we have a source from
which such stones might probably have been derived.
It is quite a well-known peculiarity of the glacial drift
to exhibit considerable assemblages of stones of a particular
character at certain spots, each of these assemblages
having probably been derived from the same
source.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would therefore suggest as probable that when
the early inhabitants of this island commenced the
erection of Stonehenge, Salisbury Plain was sprinkled
over thickly with the great white masses of the sarsen-stones
(&#8216;grey wethers&#8217;), and much more sparingly
with darker coloured boulders (the so-called &#8216;blue-stones&#8217;),
the last relics of the glacial drift, which have
been nearly denuded away. From these two kinds of
materials the stones suitable for the contemplated
temple were selected. It is even possible that the abundance
and association of these two kinds of materials
so strikingly contrasted in colour and appearance, at a
particular spot, may not only have decided the site,
but to some extent have suggested the architectural
features of the noble structure of Stonehenge.&#8221;</p>

<p>If we grant everything that Prof. Judd states, the
question remains&mdash;why did the same men in the same
place at the same time treat the sarsen and blue
stones so differently?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page93">[93]</span></p>

<p>I shall show subsequently that there is a definite
answer to the question on one assumption.</p>

<p>I next come to (2). The important point about these
stones is that with the amplitude 26&deg;, at Stonehenge,
a line from the centre of the circle over the N.W.
stone would mark the sunset place in the first week in
May, and a line over the S.E. stone would similarly
deal with the November sunrise. We are thus brought
in presence of the May-November year.</p>

<p>Another point about these stones is that they are not
at the same distance from the centre of the sarsen
stone circle, which itself is concentric with the temenos
mound; this is why they lie at different distances from
the mound. Further, a line drawn from the point of
the Friar&#8217;s Heel over the now recumbent Slaughter
Stone with the amplitude determined by Mr. Penrose
and myself for the summer solstice sunrise in 1680
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> cuts the line joining the stones at the middle point,
suggesting that the four untrimmed sarsen stones provided
alignments both for the May and June years
at about that date.</p>

<p>Nor is this all; the so-called tumuli within the
vallum (<a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>) may have been observation mounds,
for the lines passing from the northern tumulus over
the N.W. stone and from the southern tumulus over
the S.E. one are parallel to the avenue, and therefore
represent the solstitial orientation.</p>

<p>So much, then, for the stones. We see that, dealing
only with the untrimmed sarsens that remain, the
places of the May sunset and June and November sunrises
were marked from the same central point.</p>

<p>Statements have been made that there was the stump<span class="pagenum" id="Page94">[94]</span>
of another stone near the vallum to the S.W., in the
line of the Friar&#8217;s Heel and Slaughter Stone, produced
backwards, at the same distance from the old centre
as the N.W. and S.E. stones. This stone was <i>not</i>
found in an exploration by Sir Edmund Antrobus, Mr.
Penrose and Mr. Howard Payn by means of a sword
and an auger. But the question will not be settled
until surface digging is permitted, as a &#8220;road&#8221; about
which there is a present contention passes near the
spot.</p>

of the present circle and avenue. It is seen that the Friar&#8217;s Heel, the top of
which is shown in the distance, would hide the sunrise place if the axis were
a little further to the S.E.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>But even this is not the only evidence we have for<span class="pagenum" id="Page95">[95]</span>
the May worship in early times. There is an old
tradition of the slaughter of Britons by the Saxons
at Stonehenge, known as &#8220;The Treachery of the Long
Knives&#8221;; according to some accounts, 460 British
chieftains were killed while attending a banquet and
conference. Now at what time of the year did this
take place? Was it at the summer solstice on June
21? I have gathered from Guest&#8217;s &#8220;Mabinogion,&#8221; vol.
ii. p. 433, and Davies&#8217;s &#8220;Mythology of the British
Druids,&#8221; p. 333, that <i>the banquet took place on May
eve</i> &#8220;<i>Meinvethydd</i>.&#8221; Is it likely that this date would
have been chosen in a solar temple dedicated exclusively
to the solstice?</p>

<p>Now the theory to which my work and thought have
led me is that the megalithic structures at Stonehenge&mdash;the
worked sarsens with their mortices and lintels,
and above all the trilithons of the magnificent naos&mdash;represent
a re-dedication and a reconstruction, on a
more imposing plan and scale, of a much older temple,
which was originally used for worship in connection with
the May year.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER X</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE MAY AND JUNE WORSHIPS IN BRITTANY</span></h2>

<p>I purpose next to inquire whether in the wonderful
series of Megalithic remains in Brittany, remains more
extensive than any in Britain, any light is thrown on the
suggestion I have made that the May Worship preceded
the Solstitial Worship at Stonehenge.</p>

<p>It has long been known that the stones which compose
the prehistoric remains in Brittany are generally similar
in size and shape to those at Stonehenge, but, as I have
already stated, in one respect there is a vast difference.
Instead of a few, arranged in circles as at Stonehenge, we
have an enormous multitude of the so-called menhirs
arranged in many parallel lines for great distances. Some
of these are unhewn like the Friar&#8217;s Heel, some have as
certainly been trimmed.</p>

<p>The literature which has been devoted to them is very
considerable, but the authors of it, for the most part, have
taken little or no pains to master the few elementary
astronomical principles which are necessary to regard the
monuments from the point of view of orientation.</p>

<p>It is consoling to know that this cannot be said of the
last published contribution to our knowledge of this
region, which we owe to Monsieur F. Gaillard, a member<span class="pagenum" id="Page97">[97]</span>
of the Paris Anthropological Society and of the Polymathic
Society of Morbihan at Plouharnel.<a href="#Footnote18" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor18">[18]</a></p>

<p>M. Gaillard is a firm believer in the orientation theory,
and accepts the view that a very considerable number of
the alignments are solstitial. But although he gives the
correct azimuths for the solstitial points and also figures
showing the values of the obliquity of the ecliptic as far
as 2200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, his observations are not sufficiently precise
to enable a final conclusion to be drawn, and his method
of fixing the alignments and the selection of the index
menhir are difficult to gather from his memoir and the
small plans which accompany it, which, alas! deal with
compass bearings only.</p>

<p>All the same, those interested in such researches owe a
debt of gratitude to M. Gaillard for his laborious efforts to
increase our knowledge, and will sympathise with him at
the manner in which his conclusions were treated by the
Paris anthropologists. One of them, apparently thinking
that the place of sun rising is affected by the precession
of the equinoxes, used this convincing argument:&mdash;&#8220;Si, &agrave;
l&#8217;origine les alignements &eacute;taient orient&eacute;s, comme le pense
M. Gaillard, ils ne le pourraient plus &ecirc;tre aujourd&#8217;hui; au
contraire, s&#8217;ils le sont actuellement, on peut affirmer qu&#8217;ils
ne l&#8217;&eacute;taient pas alors!&#8221;</p>

<p>M. Gaillard is not only convinced of the solstitial
orientation of the avenues, but finds the same result in
the case of the dolmens.</p>

<p>I cannot find any reference in the text to any orientations
dealing with the farmers&#8217; years, that is with amplitudes<span class="pagenum" id="Page98">[98]</span>
of about 25&deg; N. and S. of the E. and W. points; but
in the diagrams on pp. 78 and 127 I find both avenue
and dolmen alignments, which within the limits of
accuracy apparently employed may perhaps with justice
be referred to them; but observations of greater accuracy
must be made, and details of the heights of the horizon
at the various points given, before anything certain can
be said about them.</p>

<p>I append a reproduction of one of M. Gaillard&#8217;s plans,
which will give an idea of his use of the index menhir. It
shows the alignments at Le M&eacute;nec, lat. 47<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg; (<a href="#Fig26">Fig. 26</a>).
The line A&mdash;Soleil runs across the stone alignments and
is fixed from A by the menhir B, but there does not seem
any good reason for selecting B except that it appears to
fall in the line of the solstitial azimuth according to M.
Gaillard. But if we take this azimuth as N. 54&deg; E., then
we find the alignments to have an azimuth roughly of N.
66&deg; E., which gives us the amplitude of 24&deg; N. marking
the place of sunrise at the beginning of the May and
November years, and the alignments may have dealt
principally with those times of the year.</p>

<p>I esteem it a most fortunate thing that while I have
been casting about as to the best way of getting more
accurate data, Lieutenant Devoir, of the French Navy
and therefore fully equipped with all the astronomical
knowledge necessary; who resides at Brest and has been
studying the prehistoric monuments in his neighbourhood
for many years, has been good enough to give me the
results of his work in that region, in which the problems
seem to be simpler than further south; for while in the
vicinity of Carnac the menhirs were erected in groups
numbering five or six thousand, near Brest, lat. 48<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg;, they<span class="pagenum" id="Page99">[99]</span>
are much more restricted in number. I am much indebted
to him for permission to use and publish his results.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>Lieutenant Devoir, by his many well-planned and
approximately accurate observations, has put the solstitial
orientation beyond question, and, further, has made important
observations which prove that the May and
August sunrises were also provided for in the systems of<span class="pagenum" id="Page100">[100]</span>
alignments. I give the following extracts from his
<span class="nowrap">letter:&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w400" id="Fig27">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 27</span>.&mdash;Menhir (A) on Melon Island.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>&#8220;It is about twelve years ago that I remarked in the
west part of the Department of Morbihan (near Lorient)
the parallelism of the lines marked out by monuments of
all sorts, and frequently oriented to the N.E., or rather
between N. 50&deg; E. and N. 55&deg; E. I had ascertained,
moreover, the existence of lines perpendicular to the first
named, the right angle being very well measured.</p>

<p>&#8220;The plans, which refer to the cantons of Ploudalm&eacute;zeau
and of St. Renan (district of Brest) and of Crozon
(district of Chateaulin), have been made on a plane-table;
the orientations are exact to one or two degrees.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the cantons of Ploudalm&eacute;zeau and of St. Renan,<span class="pagenum" id="Page101">[101]</span>
the monuments are generally simple; seven menhirs are
visible of enormous dimensions, remarkable by the
polish of their surface and the regularity of their
section. The roughnesses hardly ever reach a centimetre;
the sections are more often ovals, sometimes
rectangles with the angles rounded or terminated by
semicircles. In the canton of Crozon the monuments
are, on the contrary, complex; we find a cromlech with
an avenue leading to it of a length of 800 metres,
another of 300 metres. Unfortunately, the rocks employed
(sandstone and schist from Plungastel and
Crozon) have resisted less well than the granulite from
the north part of the Department. The monuments
are for the most part in a very bad condition; the
whole must, nevertheless, formerly have been comparable
with that of Carnac-Leomariaquer.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>&#8220;For the two regions, granitic and schistose, the
results of the observations are identical.</p>

<p>&#8220;The monuments lie along lines oriented S. 54&deg; W.<span class="pagenum" id="Page102">[102]</span>
&#8594; N. 54&deg; E. (54&deg; = azimuth at the solstices for L =
48&deg; 30&#8242; and <i>i</i> = 23&deg; 30&#8242;) and N. 54&deg; W. &#8594; S. 54&deg; E.
Some of them determine lines perpendicular to the
meridian.</p>

<div class="figcenter w500" id="Fig29">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 29</span>.&mdash;Menhirs of St. Dourzal, D, E, F.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>&#8220;One menhir (A), 6m. 90 in height and 9m. 20 in
circumference, erected in the small island of Melon
(canton of Ploudalm&eacute;zeau, latitude 48&deg; 29&#8242; 05&#8243;) a few
metres from a tumulus surrounded by the ruins of a
cromlech (B and C), has the section such that the faces,
parallel and remarkably plane, are oriented N. 54&deg; E.
(<a href="#Fig27">Figs. 27</a> and <a href="#Fig28">28</a>).</p>

<p>&#8220;At 1300 metres in the same azimuth there is a line
of three large menhirs (D, E, F), of which one (E) is
overthrown. The direction of the line passes exactly<span class="pagenum" id="Page103">[103]</span>
by the menhir A. Prolonged towards the N.E. it
meets at 3k. 700m. an overturned block of 2m. 50 in
height, which is without doubt a menhir; towards
the S.W. it passes a little to the south some lines of
the island of Mol&egrave;ne.... (<a href="#Fig29">Fig. 29</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 30</span>.&mdash;Alignment at Lagatjar, G G&#8242;.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>&#8220;There exists in the neighbourhood other groups,
forming also lines of the same orientation and that of
the winter solstice. It is advisable to remark that
orientations well determined for the solstices are much
less so for the equinoxes, which is natural, the rising
amplitude varying very rapidly at this time of year.</p>

<p>&#8220;The same general dispositions are to be found in
the complex monuments of the peninsula of Crozon.
I take for example the alignments of Lagatjar. Two
parallel lines of menhirs, G G&#8242; H H&#8242;, are oriented to S.
54&deg; E. and cut perpendicularly by a third line, I I&#8242;.
There existed less than fifty years ago a menhir at K,<span class="pagenum" id="Page104">[104]</span>
6 metres high, which is to-day broken and overturned.
This megalith, known in the country by the name of
&#8216;pierre du Conseil&#8217; (a bronze axe was found underneath
it) gives with a dolmen situated near Camaret the direction
of the sunrise on June 21 (<a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a>).</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig31">

<p class="caption long"><span class="smcap">Fig. 31</span>.&mdash;Alignments at Lagatjar, showing the pierre du Conseil and the direction
of the dolmen. From the pierre du Conseil the dolmen marks the sunrise
place at the summer solstice, and the avenue G G&#8242; H H&#8242; the sunset place
on the same day.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>&#8220;I have just spoken of the lines perpendicular to
the solstitial one; there exists more especially in the
complex monuments another particularity which merits
attention. Between two monuments, M and N, on a
solstitial line, sometimes other menhirs are noticed, the
line joining them being inclined 12&deg; to the solstitial
line, always towards the east&#8221; (<a href="#Fig32">Fig. 32</a>).</p>

<p>I must call particular attention to this important
observation of Lieutenant Devoir, for it gives us the
amplitude 24&deg; N., the direction of sunrise at the beginning
of the May and August years. It shows, moreover,
that, as at Le M&eacute;nec according to M. Gaillard, the
solstitial and May-August directions were both provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page105">[105]</span>
for at the monuments in the neighbourhood of Brest so
carefully studied by Lieutenant Devoir.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig32">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 32</span>.&mdash;Menhirs, M N on N.E.-S.W. solstitial alignment. Menhirs 1, 2, on
May-August years alignment, sunrise May-August, sunset November-February.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>Lieutenant Devoir points out the wonderful regularity
of form and the fine polish of many of the menhirs. It
will have been gathered from his account that those most
carefully trimmed and tooled belong to the solstitial
alignments. The one at Kerloas (11 metres high) heads
the list in point of size; others in the island of Melon
(7 metres), at Kergadion (8 metres and 10 metres),
Kerenneur, Kervaon and Kermabion follow suit. He
considers them to have been erected at the time of the
highest civilisation of the Megalithic peoples. He also
states that these regularly formed menhirs do not exist
at Carnac, or in the region of Pont l&#8217;Abb&eacute;, so rich in
other remains which certainly refer chiefly to the May-November
year. It seems, then, that in these localities<span class="pagenum" id="Page106">[106]</span>
the May-August worship first chiefly predominated, and
that the index menhirs of M. Gaillard which indicate
the solstice and which do not form part of the alignments
were erected subsequently.</p>

<p>Finally, then, the appeal to Brittany is entirely in
favour of the May-November year worship having
preceded the solstitial one.</p>

<p>I have already stated the evidence at Stonehenge
that the sunrise at the beginning of the May and
August years was observed in an earlier temple which
existed before the present structure existed. Were this
so we have another point common to the British and
Breton monuments. I therefore think that I may justly
claim the Brittany evidence as entirely in favour of the
suggestion put forward in <a href="#Page88">Chap. IX</a> with regard to Stonehenge.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XI</span><br />
<span class="h2name">ASTRONOMICAL HINTS FOR ARCH&AElig;OLOGISTS</span></h2>

<p>The foregoing chapters will have shown that in dealing
with the ancient monuments from an astronomical point
of view, we have to consider chiefly the direction of the
sight-lines, whether they are marked as in Brittany by
long rows of stones&mdash;alignments; as at Stonehenge by an
avenue; as in some of our British circles, by two or more
circles the direction being indicated from the central stone
of one to the central stone of the other, or finally by a
single standing stone or barrow.</p>

<p>It is important then that before we proceed further in
our inquiries we should consider how a meaning is got out
of these directions, and I propose to devote this chapter
to this question, so that the full use of the &#8220;azimuths&#8221;
already referred to and others which are to follow may be
fully understood.</p>

<p>There is another matter, at which I hinted on <a href="#Page36">pp. 36</a>
and <a href="#Page42">42</a>. We have to inquire whether there are any stones
or barrows marking the direction of the rising or setting of
<i>stars</i>, as well as those which deal with the rising and setting
of the <i>sun</i> at different times of the year, which we
have already found at Stonehenge and in Brittany. To
face this question we have to consider the stellar as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page108">[108]</span>
solar conditions of observations, and as the former are
the simpler I will begin with them, especially as now there
is no question whatever that the rising and setting of stars
were provided for.</p>

<p>In continuation of my work in Egypt in 1891, and
Mr. Penrose&#8217;s in Greece in 1892, I have recently
endeavoured to see whether there are any traces in Britain
of star observations, including those connected with the
worship of the sun at certain times of the year. We
both discovered that stars, far out of the sun&#8217;s course,
especially in Egypt, were observed in the dawn as heralds
of sunrise&mdash;&#8220;warning-stars&#8221;&mdash;so that the priests might
have time to prepare the sunrise sacrifice. To do this
properly the star should rise while the sun is still about
10&deg; below the horizon. There is also reason to believe that
stars rising not far from the north point were also used as
clock-stars to enable the time to be estimated during the
night in the same way as the time during the day could
be estimated by the position of the sun.</p>

<p>I stated (<i>Dawn of Astronomy</i>, p. 319) that Spica was
the star the heliacal rising of which heralded the sun on
May-day 3200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> in the temple of Menu at Thebes.
Sirius was associated with the summer solstice at about
the same time.</p>

<p>Mr. Penrose found this May-day worship continued at
Athens on foundations built in 1495 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> and 2020 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, on
which the Hecatompedon and older Erechtheum respectively
were subsequently built, the warning star being now no
longer Spica, but the cluster of the Pleiades rising, or
Antares setting, in the dawn.</p>

<p>It is generally known that Stonehenge is associated with
the solstitial year, and I have suggested that it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page109">[109]</span>
originally connected with the May year; but the probable
date of its re-dedication, 1680 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, was determined by
Mr. Penrose and myself by the change of obliquity.</p>

<p>Now if Stonehenge or any other British stone circle
could be proved to have used observations of warning
stars, the determination of the date when such observations
were made would be enormously facilitated. Mr.
Penrose and myself were content to think that our
date might be within 200 years of the truth, whereas
if we could use the rapid movement of stars in declination
brought about by the precession of the equinoxes,
instead of the slow change of the sun&#8217;s declination
brought about by the change of the value of the
obliquity, a possible error of 200 years would be reduced
to one of 10 years.</p>

<p>In spite of this enormous advantage, no one so far
as I know has yet made any inquiry to connect star
observations with any of the British circles.</p>

<p>I have recently obtained clear evidence that some
circles in different parts of Britain were used for night
work and also in relation to the May year, which
we know was general over the whole of Europe in
early times, and which still determines the quarter-days
in Scotland.</p>

<p>If the Egyptian and Greek practice were continued
here, we should expect then to find some indications of the
star observations utilised at the temple of Min and at
the Hecatompedon for the beginning, or the other chief
months, of the May year.</p>

<p>I have found them, and I will now show the method
employed.</p>

<p>To begin with, if we assume that the astronomer-priests<span class="pagenum" id="Page110">[110]</span>
here did attempt such observations, what is
the most likely way in which they would have gone
to work?</p>

<p>The easiest way for the astronomer-priests to conduct
such observations in a stone circle would be to erect
a stone or barrow indicating the direction of the place on
the horizon at which the star would rise as seen from the
centre of the circle. If the dawn the star was to
herald occurred in the summer, the stone or barrow itself
might be visible if not too far away, but there was a
reason why they should not be too close; in a solemn
ceremonial the less seen of the machinery the better.</p>

<p>Doubtless such stones and barrows would be rendered
obvious in the dark by a light placed on or near them.
Cups which could hold oil or grease are known in
connection with such stones, and a light thus fed would
suffice in the open if there were no wind; but in windy
weather a cromlech or some similar shelter must have
been provided for it.</p>

<p>Now if these standing stones or barrows were ever
erected and still remain, accurate plans&mdash;not the slovenly
plans with which Ferguson and too many others have provided
us, giving us either no indication of the north or any
other point, or else a rough compass bearing without
taking the trouble to state the variation at the time and
place&mdash;will help us.</p>

<p>I have already pointed out that much time has been lost
in the investigation of our stone circles, for the reason
that in many cases the exact relations of the monuments
to the chief points of the horizon, and therefore to the
place of sunrise at different times of the year, have not
been considered; and when they were, the observations<span class="pagenum" id="Page111">[111]</span>
were made only with reference to the magnetic north,
which is different at different places, and besides is always
varying; few indeed have tried to get at the real
astronomical conditions of the problem. The first, I think,
was Mr. Jonathan Otley, who in 1849 showed the
&#8220;orientation&#8221; of the Keswick circle &#8220;according to the
solar meridian,&#8221; giving true solar bearings throughout the
year.</p>

<p>In my opinion the most accurate plans conceivable,
in the absence of a long and minute local inquiry, are the
25-inch maps of the Ordnance Survey, on which, I have
it on the authority of Colonel Johnston the distinguished
Director, each stone may be taken to be shown with a
limit of error of 6 feet. With a large circular protractor
azimuths can be read to one minute of arc, and in critical
cases the true azimuth of the side lines, which are not
necessarily meridians as latitudes are not marked, can be
found on inquiry at the Ordnance Office, Southampton.</p>

<p>Having then true azimuths, the next question concerns
the declinations of the stars which may have been
observed.</p>

<p>The work of Stockwell in America, Danckworth in
Germany,<a href="#Footnote19" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor19">[19]</a> and Dr. W. J. S. Lockyer in England, has
provided us with tables of the changing declinations
of stars throughout past time, or enough of it for our
purpose.</p>

<p>An accurate determination on the 25-inch map of either
the <i>azimuth</i> (angular distance from the N. or S. points)
or <i>amplitude</i> (angular distance from the E. or W. points)<span class="pagenum" id="Page112">[112]</span>
of the stone or barrow as seen from the centre of the stone
circle will enable us to determine the declination of the
star at the time when it was observed.</p>

<p>I give a <a href="#Fig33">diagram</a> which enables this determination
to be made with the greatest ease for any monuments
between Land&#8217;s End and John o&#8217; Groats, whether the
direction is recorded by amplitude or azimuth; the
declination is read at the side from the value of either
indicated, say, by a dot, at the proper latitude.</p>

<p>This, of course, only gives us a first approximation.
The angular height of the point on the horizon to which the
alignment or sight-line is directed by the stone or barrow
from the centre of the circle must be most accurately
determined, otherwise the declinations may be one or two
degrees out.</p>

<p>In the absence of measurements it is convenient to
assume, in the first instance, that the horizon is half a
degree high, as with this elevation refraction is
compensated, as the following table will show:</p>

<p>It is obvious that a star used all the year round for
night work will warn the sunrise at some one of the yearly
festivals.</p>

<p>When the stars having the same declinations are considered
from this point of view, the star actually used,
and <i>therefore the date of its use</i>, may generally be
gathered. I shall show subsequently that some of the
stars in the above lists were actually observed in British
as well as in Grecian temples.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">ASTRONOMICAL HINTS FOR ARCH&AElig;OLOGISTS&mdash;<i>Continued.</i></span></h2>

<p>I next come to the sun observations.</p>

<p>First we must consider the astronomical differences
between the rising of a star and of the sun, by
which we generally mean that small part of the sun&#8217;s
limb first visible.</p>

<p>It is frequently imagined that for determining the
exact place of sunrise or sunset in connection with
these ancient monuments we have to deal with the
sun&#8217;s centre, as we should do with the sun half risen.
As a matter of fact, we must consider that part of
the sun&#8217;s limb which first makes its appearance above
the horizon; the first glimpse of the upper limb of the
sun is in question, say, when the visible limb is 2&#8242;
high; and we must carefully take the height of the hills
over which it rises into account.</p>

<p>The accompanying <a href="#Fig36">diagram</a> will at once show the
difference between the rising conditions we have now
to consider. It deals with the summer solstice, as
being the most precise case, in Lat. 59&deg; N.</p>

<p>At this time the position of the sun, <i>that is of the
sun&#8217;s centre</i>, as given in the &#8220;Nautical Almanac,&#8221; is
represented by the double circle on the sea horizon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page120">[120]</span></p>

<p>The azimuth of this position is N. 39&deg; 16&#8242; E. This
is the equivalent of the declination of a star, but it
will be seen that the real azimuths we want are
very different. The dotted circles represent the actual
position of the sun with regard to the horizon, the
continuous circles the apparent positions caused by the
lifting-up effect of refraction. We have the positions
in azimuth of the apparent sun as it appears on a sea
horizon, and when the horizon is formed by hills up to
1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg; in vertical height.</p>

<p>To make this quite clear I give a table which has
been computed by Mr. Rolston, of the Solar Physics
Observatory, showing azimuths with hills up to 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&deg;
high for lat. 59&deg; N., and 51&deg; N. nearly the latitude of
Stonehenge, of the sun&#8217;s upper limb for the summer

<p>The first important thing we learn from the table is
that although at both solstices the azimuths of the
rising and setting of the sun&#8217;s centre are the same,
these azimuths of the upper limb at the summer and
winter solstices differ in a high northern latitude by
some 5&deg;. The difference arises, of course, from the
fact that the limb is some 16&#8242; from the sun&#8217;s centre,
so that considering the sun&#8217;s centre as a star with
fixed declination, at rising the limb appears before the
centre, and at setting it lags behind it.</p>

<p>It will also be seen that at sunrise hills increase the
azimuth from N., and refraction reduces it; while at
setting, hills reduce the azimuth from S. and refraction
increases it.</p>

<p>This <a href="#Fig36">diagram</a> and <a href="#Page120">table</a> should fully explain the
variation of azimuth at sunrise caused by the fact that
from our present point of view we do not deal with
the sun as a star.</p>

<p>To make the foregoing applicable for monuments in
all latitudes between Brittany and the Orkneys, I give
still another diagram, <a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a>, also prepared for me by
Mr. Rolston which will enable any arch&aelig;ologist to
determine approximately, <i>for the present time</i>, the
azimuth of sunrise at the summer solstice, without
waiting for the 21st of June in any year actually to
observe it.</p>

<p>As before stated, I have dealt with the solstice in
this chapter because it affords us the most precise
case. I hope to be able to deal with the May year
sun in the same way later on.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XIII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">STENNESS (Lat. 59&deg; N.).</span></h2>

<p>I wrote a good deal in <i>Nature</i><a href="#Footnote20" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor20">[20]</a> on sun and star
temples in 1891, and Mr. Lewis the next year expressed
the opinion that the British stone monuments, or some
of them, were sun and star temples.</p>

<p>Mr. Magnus Spence, of Deerness, in Orkney, published
a pamphlet, &#8220;Standing Stones and Maeshowe of Stenness,&#8221;<a href="#Footnote21" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor21">[21]</a>
in 1894; it is a reprint of an article in the
<i>Scottish Review</i>, October, 1893, showing that the stones
were set up for solar worship. Mr. Cursiter, F.S.A., of
Kirkwall, in a letter to me dated March 15, 1894, a
letter suggested by my &#8220;Dawn of Astronomy,&#8221; which
appeared in that year, and in which the articles which
had been published in <i>Nature</i> in 1891 had been expanded,
directed my attention to the pamphlet.</p>

<p>I began the consideration of the Stenness circles and
alignments in 1901, but other pressing calls on my time
then caused me to break off the inquiry. Quite recently
it occurred to me that a complete study of the Stenness
circles might throw light on the question of an earlier
Stonehenge, so I have gone over the old papers, plotting
the results on the Ordnance map.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page124">[124]</span></p>

James Farrer, M.P. (1862).</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page125">[125]</span></p>

<p>Now that the inquiry is as complete as I can make
it without spending some time in Orkney with a
theodolite, I will begin my reference to other circles
besides Stonehenge by stating the conclusions at which
I have arrived with regard to the stones of Stenness.</p>

<p>In the first place I may state that although many
of the alignments to which Mr. Spence refers in his
pamphlet on Maeshowe prove to be very different from
those he supposed and drew on the map which accompanies
his paper, the main point of his contention is
amply confirmed.</p>

<p>I give a <a href="#Fig39">copy</a> of the Ordnance map showing the
true orientation of these and of other sight-lines I
have made out.</p>

<p>The alignments on which Mr. Spence chiefly depended
were two, one running from the stone circle past the
entrance of Maeshowe to the place of sunrise at Hallowe&#8217;en
(November 1), another from the same circle by
the Barnhouse standing stone to the mid-winter sunrise
at the solstice.</p>

<p>Although the map gives these sight-lines, I shall show
that they had not the use Mr. Spence attributes to them;
but still observations of the sun were provided for on
the days in question, and the circles and outstanding
stones were undoubtedly set up to guide astronomical
observations relating to the different times of the year.
Of course, as I have shown elsewhere, such astronomical
observations were always associated with religious celebrations
of one kind or another, as the astronomer and
the priest were one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page126">[126]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig39">

from the stones of Stenness.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page127">[127]</span></p>

<p>I shall not refer to all the sight-lines indicated, but
deal only with those which I have without local
knowledge been able to test and justify by means of
the 25-inch Ordnance map.</p>

<p>Not only does calculation prove the worship of the
May and June years, but I think the facts now before
us really go to show that in Orkney the May year was
the first established, and that the solstitial (June) year
came afterwards, and this was one of the chief questions
I had in view.</p>

<p>I will begin with the May year. I have already
shown, <a href="#Page22">p. 22</a>, that the half-way time between an
equinox and a solstice is when the sun&#8217;s centre has a
declination approximately 16&deg; 20&#8242; N. or S. In Orkney,
with the latitude of 59&deg;, assuming a sea horizon, the
approximate amplitude of sunrise or sunset is 33&deg; 6&#8242;,
the corresponding azimuth being 56&deg; 54&#8242;.</p>

<p>Now the most interesting and best defined line near
this azimuth on the Ordnance map is the one stretching
S.E. from the centre of the Stenness circle to the
Barnstone, with an azimuth of 57&deg; 15&#8242;. The line
contains between the two points I have named another
stone, the Watchstone, 18<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet high, in the precise
alignment; and from the statements made and
measures given it is to be inferred that a still more
famous and perforated stone, the &#8220;Stone of Odin,&#8221;
demolished seventy years since, was also in the same
line within the extremities named.</p>

<p>If we may accept this we learn something about
perforated stones, and can understand most of the folk
lore associated with them, and few have more
connected with them than the one at Stenness. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page128">[128]</span>
suggest that the perforation, which was in this case
5 feet from the ground, was used by the astronomer-priest
to view the sunrise in November over the Barnhouse
stone in one direction, and the sunset in May over
the circle in the other. I hope to be able to return
to this question subsequently.</p>

<p>There is another echo of this fundamental line; that
joining the Ring of Bookan and the Stones of Via has
the same azimuth and doubtless served the same
purpose for the May year.</p>

<p>But this line, giving us the May sunset and November
sunrise, <i>not</i> the December solstitial sunrise as Mr.
Spence shows it, is not the only orientation connected with
the May year at the stones of Stenness. The November
sunset is provided for by a sight-line from the
circle to a stone across the Loch of Stenness with an
azimuth of S. 53&deg; 30&#8242; W.</p>

<p>To apply the table, given on <a href="#Page120">p. 120</a>, to the solstitial
risings and settings at Stenness, and the sight-lines
which I have plotted on the map, it will be seen that
the table shows us that the lines marked</p>

<div class="split5050 w50pc">

<p class="clearline">&nbsp;</p>

</div><!--splt5050-->

<p class="noindent">are solstitial lines; to get exact agreement with the
table the heights of the hills must be found and
allowed for.</p>

<p>I have roughly determined this height from the 1-inch
map in the case of the Barnstone-Maeshowe alignment.
On the N.E. horizon are the Burrien Hills, four miles
away, 600 feet high at the sunrise place, gradually
ascending to the E., vertical angle = 1&deg; 36&#8242; 30&#8243;. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page129">[129]</span>
near alignment is on and over the centre of Maeshowe.
Colonel Johnston, the Director-General of the Ordnance
Survey, has informed me that the true azimuth of this
bearing is N. 41&deg; 16&#8242; E., and in all probability it
represents the place of sunrise as seen from the Barnstone
when Maeshowe was erected. What is most
required in Orkney now is that some one with a good
6-inch theodolite should observe the sun&#8217;s place of
rising and the angular height of the hills at the next
summer solstice in order to determine the date of the
erection of Maeshowe. Mr. Spence and others made
an attempt to determine this value with a sextant in
1899, but not from the Barnstone.</p>

<p>In the absence of this observation we may use the
<a href="#Fig37">diagram</a> given on p. 121. With the height of hill previously
given the sun should rise according to calculation
at about the azimuth N. 41&deg; 50&#8242; E.</p>

<p>The difference between the new and old azimuth
then, on the assumption that az. N. 41&deg; 16&#8242; E. really
represents an observation over Maeshowe, gives us the
difference of date.</p>

<p>Treating these figures then as we have done in the
case of Stonehenge in <a href="#Page62">Chapter VII</a>, the result is as
follows. The Barnhouse-Maeshowe line was established
about 700 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, when the obliquity had a value of 23&deg; 48&#8242;
according to Stockwell&#8217;s tables. (<a href="#Fig40">Fig. 40</a>.)</p>

<p>I confess the late date does not surprise me. The
masonry of Maeshowe differs widely from that of other
similar structures in that the sides of the gallery and
chamber, instead of being composed of upright stones,
are built in regular courses.</p>

<p>I do not believe that the Maeshowe structure was<span class="pagenum" id="Page130">[130]</span>
built to observe a winter sunrise twenty days from the
solstice, nor can I think it was set up at midsummer
by someone who had only dealt with a high sun and
a sea horizon, and imagined that the sunrise and sunset
points were exactly opposite to each other. It was
a priest&#8217;s house, and the alignment of the passage to the
Barnstone was for the exchange of signals, probably by
lights in Maeshowe itself.</p>

<p>The Ordnance maps give no indication of stones, &amp;c.,
by which the direction of the midsummer setting or
the midwinter rising and setting might have been
indicated from either the Maeshowe or the Barnstone.</p>

<p>To sum up the solar alignments from the circle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page131">[131]</span></p>

<p>We have the May sunrise marked by the top of
Burrien Hill, from 600 to 700 feet high, Az. 59&deg; 30&#8242;.</p>

<p>We have the November sunset marked by a standing
stone on the other side of the Loch of Stenness,
Az. 53&deg; 30&#8242;.</p>

<p>June rising, Line from Barnstone over Maeshowe
tumulus.</p>

<p>December rising, tumulus (Az. 41&deg;) on Ward Hill.</p>

<p>December setting, tumulus Onston 36&deg; 30&#8242;.</p>

<p>It is not a little remarkable that the summer solstice
rising and the winter solstice rising and setting seem
to have been provided for at the Stenness circle by
alignment on the centres of tumuli, two of them, across
the Loch, one the Onston tumulus to the S.W.
(Az. 36&deg; 30&#8242;), the other tumulus being on Ward Hill
to the S.E., Az. 41&deg; (rough measurement).</p>

<p>If the Maeshowe tumulus was a structure erected at the
time I have suggested to use the Barnstone for the summer
solstice rising; then these two other tumuli, to deal
with the winter solstice at Stenness circle, may have
been built at the same time. All these provided for a
new cult.</p>

<p>There are also tumuli near the line (which cannot be
exactly determined because the heights of the hills are
unknown) of the summer solstice setting; none was
required for the sunrise at this date, as the line passes
over the highest point of Hindera fiold, a natural tumulus
more than 500 feet high, and on that account a triangulation
station.</p>

<p>Another argument in favour of the tumuli being
additions to the original design is that the place of the
<i>November</i> setting from the Stenness circle is marked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page132">[132]</span>
<i>not</i> by a tumulus, but by a standing stone. As this
stone, near Deepdale, and the tumulus at Onston are
only about 1200 yards apart, the suggestion may be
made that under certain unknown conditions and
possibly in later times tumuli in some cases replaced
stones as collimation marks.</p>

<p>With regard to the clock-star, it is to be feared that
the stones in the N.E. quadrant as viewed from the
circle which might have given us a clue have been
removed. As the latitude of Stenness is N. 59&deg;, some
star with a less declination than N. 31&deg; would have
been chosen, assuming that the sky-line towards the
N. point is not very high.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XIV</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE HURLERS (Lat. 50&deg; 31&#8242; N.)</span></h2>

<p>The sight-lines to which I have drawn attention in
relation to the stones of Stenness had to do with the
places of sunrise and sunset in the May and Solstitial
years. I now pass to another group of circles in which
we deal chiefly with the places of star-rise and star-set,
some of the stars being used as warners for sunrise at
the critical times of the two years in question.</p>

<p>Following the clue given me in the case of the
Egyptian temples, such as Luxor, by successive small
changes of the axis necessitated by the change in a
star&#8217;s place due to precession, I began this stellar
branch of the inquiry by looking out for this peculiarity
in an examination of many maps and plans of circles.</p>

<p>I very soon came across two examples in which the
sight-line had been changed in the Egyptian manner.
The first is the three circles of the Hurlers, some
5 miles to the north of Liskeard, a plan of which is
given in &#8220;Prehistoric Stone Monuments of the British
Isles: Cornwall,&#8221; by W. C. Lukis, Rector of Wath,
Yorkshire, published by the Society of Antiquaries, who
were so good as to furnish me with a copy, and also<span class="pagenum" id="Page134">[134]</span>
some <i>unfolded</i> plans on which sight-lines could be
accurately drawn and their azimuths determined. I am
anxious to express my obligations to the council and
officers of the society for the help thus afforded me.</p>

<p>The three circles are thus referred to by Lukis
in the valuable monograph which I have already
mentioned.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the moor, about a mile to the south of the
singular pile of granite slabs, which rest upon and
overlap each other, and is vulgarly called the Cheesewring,
there are three large circles of granite stones
placed in a nearly straight line in a north-north-east,
and south-south-west direction, of which the middle
one is the largest, being 135 feet in diameter, the north
110 feet, and the south 105 feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;The north Circle is 98 feet, and the south 82 feet
from the central one. If a line be drawn uniting
the centres of the extreme Circles, the centre of the
middle ring is found to be 12 feet 6 inches to the west
of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;These Circles have been greatly injured. The
largest consists of 9 erect and 5 prostrate stones; the
north Circle has 6 erect and 6 prostrate, and a fragment
of a seventh; and the south has 3 erect and 8 prostrate.
In Dr. Borlase&#8217;s time they were in a slightly better
condition. A pen-and-ink sketch made by him, which
is extant in one of Dr. Stukeley&#8217;s volumes of original
drawings, represents the middle Circle as consisting of
7 erect and 10 prostrate stones; the north of 10 erect
and 6 prostrate; and the south of 3 erect and 9
prostrate. The stone to the east of that marked C in
the plan of the middle Circle is the highest, and is<span class="pagenum" id="Page135">[135]</span>
5 feet 8 inches out of the ground, and appears to have
been wantonly mutilated recently. Two of the prostrate
stones of the north Circle are 6 feet 6 inches in
length.</p>

<p>&#8220;About 17 feet south from the centre of the middle
Circle there is a prostrate stone 4 feet long and
15 inches wide at one end. It may possibly have been
of larger dimensions formerly, and been erected on the
spot where it now lies, but as Dr. Borlase has omitted
it in his sketch it is probably a displaced stone of the
ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we allow, as before, an average interval of 12 feet
between the stones, there will have been about 28 pillars
in the north, 26 in the south, and 33 in the middle
Circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;At a distance of 409 feet westwards from K in the
middle Circle there are 2 stones, 7 feet apart, both
inclined northwards. One is 4 feet 11 inches in height
out of the ground, and overhangs its base 2 feet
7 inches; the other is 5 feet 4 inches high, and overhangs
18 inches.&#8221;</p>

<p>I now pass from a general description of the circles
to the azimuths of the sight-lines already referred to,
so far as they can be determined from the published
Ordnance maps.</p>

<p>To investigate them as completely as possible without
local observations in the first instance, I begged Colonel
Johnston, R.E., C.B., the Director-General of the
Ordnance Survey, to send me the 25-inch maps of the
site giving the exact azimuth of the side lines. This
he obligingly did, and I have to express my great indebtedness
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page136">[136]</span></p>

<p>In <a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a> I show the sight-lines from the south and
north Circles as determined by the stones and barrows
marked on the map. The sight-lines on Arcturus are from
the centres of the three circles in succession. I shall
point out later the significance of the fact that the
November alignments are from the south, the solstitial
ones from the north Circle.</p>

<p>Of the various sight-lines found, those to which I
wish to direct attention in the first instance, and which
led me to the others, are approximately, reading the
azimuths to the nearest degree,</p>

<p>In a preliminary inquiry in anticipation of the
necessary local observations with a theodolite, I assumed
hills half a degree high, for the reason given on <a href="#Page112">p. 112</a>.
We have the following declinations <span class="nowrap">approximately:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Here, then, we have declinations to work on, but
declinations of what star? To endeavour to answer
this question I studied the declinations of the three
brightest stars in the northern heavens, having approximately
the declinations in question some time or
other during the period 0 to 2500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Vega is ruled out as its declination was too high.
The remaining stars Capella and Arcturus may have
been observed so far as the declinations go. For time
limits we <span class="nowrap">have:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Now there is no question as to which of these two
stars we have to deal with, for the northern circle is<span class="pagenum" id="Page138">[138]</span>
evidently less ancient than the others, for some of the
stones are squared and the others are less irregular than
those in the S. circle.</p>

<p>This being so, the approximate dates of the use of
the three circles at the Hurlers can be derived. They
are, with the above <span class="nowrap">assumption:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The next step was to obtain, by means of a large
circular protractor, more accurate readings of the
Ordnance Map. This I could do, but the all important
question of the angular height of the horizon remained.
As it was impossible for me to leave London when the
significance of the alignments was made out, I appealed
to the authorities of the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic
Society for aid in obtaining the necessary angles, and
as a result, Captain J. S. Henderson, of Falmouth, an
accomplished surveyor, volunteered his aid and shortly
sent me the angular heights along some of the alignments,
the means of eight readings obtained with a
6-inch theodolite, both verniers and reversed telescopes
being employed. Other students of science besides
myself will, I am sure, feel their indebtedness for such
opportune help.</p>

<p>The combination of the large protractor and theodolite
work gives the following final values. The
difference between them and the provisional ones
given above speaks volumes as to the necessity of a
local study of the height of the horizon, a point I
believe invariably neglected by arch&aelig;ologists.</p>

<p>Now before this evidence of star worship, so important
if it can be depended on, could be accepted, it
was necessary to make a special inquiry as to the
existence of similar star observations in other places.
Many have been found of which more in the sequel.</p>

<p>The next point which arose was that Arcturus used
as a clock-star (<a href="#Page108">p. 108</a>) would serve as a warner for
August. This necessitated another inquiry into the
chief festivals in Cornwall: among these the August
(Harvest) festival is one.</p>

<p>Another point to consider was whether there was
any evidence of a local August festival. It happens
that the Hurlers are in the parish of St. Cleer, and
some of the other Arcturus sight-lines are in that of
St. Just. Now, a local festival in old days was often
associated with the local Saint. As most of the
Cornish Saints are common to Cornwall and Brittany,
I looked up the Calendar of the <i>Annuaire</i> of the
<i>Institut de France</i>, and found that the days dedicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page140">[140]</span>
to SS. Justin and Claire are the 9th and 12th of
August. It seems, then, that at the Hurlers it was
really a question of a clock-star also used as a warning
star for the August festival. I think we have at last,
then, run to earth the origin of some of the northerly
alignments referred to on <a href="#Page36">pages 36</a> and <a href="#Page43">43</a>.</p>

<p>It will have been noted that the last sight-line on
Arcturus was marked by a barrow. Captain Henderson
inspected it and found it much ruined by explorers,
remains of a chamber inside being visible.</p>

<p>In a subsequent visit, in which Captain Henderson
was accompanied by Mr. Horton Bolitho, my wife and
myself, we not only visited this barrow, but found that
the whole hill had been honeycombed to such an
extent by mining operations that it was very difficult
to discriminate between &#8220;investigated&#8221; barrows and
other heaps and holes, unless the barrow showed the
remains of a chamber.</p>

<p>Our examination was not limited to barrows.
Captain Henderson had spent a long bleak day in examining
and measuring the stones marked on the
Ordnance Map, to which I had called his special
attention. We went over part of the ground with him,
and came to the conclusion that the whole question of
the Cornish treatment of &#8220;ancient stones&#8221; would
have to be gone into&mdash;an inquiry which Mr. Bolitho is
now carrying on.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that any stone or barrow
used in the sight-lines we are now considering must
have been put up nearly 4,000 years ago, so long ago,
in fact, that many of the chief barrows have been
reduced to the skeletons of their former selves, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page141">[141]</span>
enclosed stone chamber, built of mighty stones, alone
remaining.</p>

<p>Cromlechs and standing stones then formed important
points in the landscape long before ecclesiastical
divisions were thought of, or any attempt was made
to indicate the boundaries of private property.</p>

<p>We should expect then to find these ancient
monuments freely made use of to mark what we now
term &#8220;parish boundaries.&#8221; This is so. Four parishes
have thus used one of the larger cromlechs, and it is
more than probable that something beside the denunciation
of the <i>cultus lapidum</i>, which we have
seen at work in Brittany (<a href="#Page39">p. 39</a>), has been responsible
for the many stone crosses in Cornwall. Of some of
them near circles I have gathered the astronomical use,
while now they &#8220;mark the bounds,&#8221; as do some of the
stone rows in Dartmoor.</p>

<p>I believe that in later times this practice of the
Church was followed by those among whom the land
was distributed, and this has gone on till at last there
are many ancient stones trimmed on one side and
bearing initials and so having a modern appearance.
The astronomer, and even the arch&aelig;ologist, may regret
this practice, but as the habit in Cornwall appears to
be for anybody to use the nearest uncrossed and uninitialled
stone for a wall or a pigsty, Mr. Bolitho&#8217;s
inquiry may show that in some cases, at all events, it
has been a blessing in disguise, for the stones are still
there.</p>

<p>In the case of a long chambered barrow, the top of
which nearly touches the horizon, as seen from a circle
near it, there is less danger of being misled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page142">[142]</span></p>

<p>In my notes on the stones of Stenness (<a href="#Page123">Chapter XIII</a>)
I pointed out that the chambered Cairns at Onston
and Maeshowe suggested that such structures were later
variants of the more ancient standing stones. Some
barrows at the Hurlers lend further confirmation of this
view. I will deal with them first. Of one the data
are Az. from N. Circle S. 72&deg; 49&#8242; W., height of horizon
12&#8242; (Capt. Henderson). The resulting declination is
S. 11&deg; 5&#8242;, the declination of Antares 1720 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> But
why should Antares be thus singled out? The table
on <a href="#Page117">page 117</a> shows the reason. At the date involved
the setting of Antares in the dawn was the warner of
the sunrise on May morning, the greatest day in all
the year.</p>

<p>Is there any precedent for this use of Antares?</p>

<p>I have already pointed out (<a href="#Page108">p. 108</a>) that Mr. Penrose
found the warning stars for May morning at the dates
of foundation of the Hecatompedon, and the older
Erechtheum, to be the group of the Pleiades rising
and <i>Antares</i> setting. As the foundations of the
Hecatompedon were built only some few years after the
stones of the central circle of the Hurlers were used,
we ought to find traces of the observations of the
same May-morning stars.</p>

<p>We have, then, now a third term in the astronomical
use of stars to herald the sunrise on May morning.</p>

<p>The next barrow to be referred to&mdash;it is shown
to be a long one on the Ordnance Map&mdash;is situated<span class="pagenum" id="Page143">[143]</span>
near the top of Caradon Hill, and is visible on the sky-line
from the circles. Data: Az. from N. Circle S. 65&deg; E.,
height of horizon 1&deg; 38&#8242; (Henderson). This corresponds
almost exactly with the azimuth of the rise of the
sun&#8217;s upper limb with declination S. 16&deg; 20&#8242; on the two
critical dates in November and February of the May-year
(Halloween and Candlemas, see <a href="#Page23">p. 23</a>), so I am
inclined to consider it more than a mere coincidence
that the azimuths coincide so closely. It, however,
may be urged that there are other barrows on Caradon
Hill, but judging from the Ordnance Map they seem
to be of the round variety used for burials, perhaps a
thousand years after the circles were in use, and in
my opinion by a different race of men; but this matter
must not detain us now, I hope to return to it later.</p>

<p>Still one more barrow and a stone, uncrossed and
uninitialled, in the same sight-line, data: Az. from
N. circle S. 59&deg; 35&#8242; E. Height of horizon 1&deg; 38&#8242; 23&#8243;
(Henderson), resulting declination S. 19&deg; 50&#8242;. This was
the declination of Sirius 1690 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> Why Sirius? The
table on <a href="#Page117">p. 117</a> gives us the answer. Sirius replaced
Arcturus as a warning star for the August festival,
and we have seen that the last use of Arcturus was
connected with the sight-line to the barrow about
1900 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>I pass now from barrows to stones. There is one
about which there can be no question. It is a famous
Cross, a &#8220;Longstone&#8221; at which all travellers stop on
their way from St. Cleer to the Hurlers. It occupies
nearly the same position on the S.W. horizon as does
the long tumulus on Caradon Hill in the S.E. quadrant.
From the <i>South</i> Circle, and this is important, its<span class="pagenum" id="Page144">[144]</span>
Azimuth, S. 64&deg; W., is nearly the same; it marked, and
still marks, the sunset point on the critical days of
the May year in November and February.</p>

<p>There is another stone marked on the Ordnance Map
Az. N. 88&deg; E. from the N. circle. It has been removed,
so I may fairly assume that it was really an ancient
stone. Captain Henderson&#8217;s value for the height of
the horizon is 11&#8242; 31&#8243;. The table on <a href="#Page117">p. 117</a> will
show that in this direction we have to deal with
Betelgeuse as a warner for the summer solstice. The
resulting date is 1730 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>It would appear that possibly this is not the only
stone dealing with (later) solstitial alignments. Lukis
gives two stones on the west side of the circles which
on the Ordnance Map are classed as boundary stones:
they lie on a boundary beyond all question, but also
beyond all question they are as ancient as the stones
of the circles themselves. From the N. circle they are
almost but not quite in a line, and the azimuth of the
south stone is S. 49&deg; W. This is a solstitial azimuth.
I think, therefore, that we may accept this as another
evidence of the worship of the setting sun at the
winter solstice, <i>from the N. circle</i>, and in this we
have still further evidence that to the worship of
the May year in the south circle was added later one
dealing with the solstitial year which was chiefly carried
on in the N. circle.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page145">[145]</span></p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XV</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE DARTMOOR AVENUES</span></h2>

<p>In <a href="#Page107">Chapter XI.</a> I referred to the very numerous
alignments of stones in Brittany, and I was allowed by
Lieutenant Devoir, of the French Navy, to give some
of his theodolite observations of the directions along
which the stones had been set up.</p>

<p>The conclusion was that we were really dealing with
monuments connected with the worship of the sun of
the May year, a year which the recent evidence has
shown to have been the first used after the length
of the year had been determined; thus replacing the
lunar unit of time which was in vogue previously, and
the use of which is brought home to us by the reputed
ages of Methuselah and other biblical personages, who
knew no other measurer of time than the moon.</p>

<p>There was also evidence to the effect that in later
times solstitial alignments had been added, so that the
idea that we were dealing with astronomically oriented
rows of stones was greatly strengthened, not to say
established.</p>

<p>So long as the Brittany alignments were things of
mystery, their origin, as well as that of the more or less
similar monuments in Britain, was variously explained;<span class="pagenum" id="Page146">[146]</span>
they were models in stone of armies in battle array, or
they represented funeral processions, to mention only two
suggestions. I should add that Mr. H. Worth, who has
devoted much time to their study, considers that some
sepulchral interest attaches to them, though he thinks
it may be argued that that was secondary, even as are
interments in cathedrals and churches. About burials
associated with them, of course, there is no question,
for the kistvaens and cairns are there; but my observations
suggest that they were added long after the avenues
were built, because some cairns <i>block</i> avenues. Perhaps
a careful study of the modes of burial adopted may throw
light on this point.</p>

<p>The equivalents of the Brittany alignments are not
common in Britain; they exist in the greatest number
on Dartmoor, whither I went recently to study them.
The conditions on high Dartmoor are peculiar; dense
blinding mists are common, and, moreover, sometimes
come on almost without warning. From its conformation
the land is full of streams. There are stones everywhere.
What I found, therefore, as had others before me, was
that as a consequence of the conditions to which I have
referred, directions had been indicated by rows of stones
for quite other than ceremonial purposes. Here, then,
was another possible origin. It was a matter of great
importance to discriminate most carefully between these
alignments, and to endeavour to sort them out. My
special inquiry, of course, was to see if they, like their
apparent equivalents in Brittany, could have had an
astronomical origin. The first thing to do, then, was to
see which might have been erected for worship or which
for practical purposes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page147">[147]</span></p>

<p>In doing this there is no difficulty in dealing with
extremes. Thus one notable line of large flat stones has
been claimed by Messrs. R. N. Worth and R. Burnard
as a portion of the Great Fosseway (Rowe&#8217;s <i>Perambulation</i>,
third edition, p. 63); it has been traced for
eighteen miles from beyond Hameldon nearly to
Tavistock, the stones being about 2 feet thick and the
road 10 feet wide.</p>

<div class="figcenter w450" id="Fig42">

<img src="images/illo159.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="323" />

<p class="photocredit"><i>Photo. by Lady Lockyer.</i></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 42.</span>&mdash;The Southern Avenue at Merrivale, looking East.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>There are two notable avenues of upright stones at
Merrivale; they are in close connection with a circle,
and could have had no practical use. These stones,
then, we may claim as representing the opposite extreme
of the Fosseway and as suggesting an astronomical, as
opposed to a practical, use; the adjacent circle, of course
greatly strengthens this view.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page148">[148]</span></p>

<p>It is between these extremes that difficulties may
arise, but the verdict can, in a great many cases at all
events, be settled without any very great hesitation,
especially where practical or astronomical uselessness
can be established. But even here care is necessary, as
I shall show.</p>

<p>The stones now in question, originally upright, are
variously called avenues, rows, alignments or parallelithons.
Their study dates from 1827, when Rowe and
Colonel Hamilton Smith examined those at Merrivale
(Rowe, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 31). Their number has increased
with every careful study of any part of the moor, and
doubtless many are still unmapped.<a href="#Footnote22" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor22">[22]</a> The late Mr. R. N.
Worth, of Plymouth, and his son, Mr. H. Worth, have
given great attention to these monuments, and the
former communicated a paper on them to the Devonshire
Association for the Advancement of Science in 1892
(<i>Trans.</i>, xxv. pp. 387-417).</p>

<p>A word of caution must be said before I proceed.
We must not take for granted that the stone-rows are
now as they left the hands of the builders. The
disastrous carelessness of the Government in the matter
of our national antiquities is, I am locally informed,
admirably imitated by the Devonshire County and other
lesser councils, and, indeed, by anybody who has a road
to mend or a wall to build. On this account, any of
the rows may once have been much longer and with
an obvious practical use; and those which now appear<span class="pagenum" id="Page149">[149]</span>
to be far removed from circles may once have been
used for sacred processions at shrines which have disappeared.</p>

<p>Again, the rows of stones we are now considering
must not be confounded with the &#8220;track lines&#8221; or
&#8220;boundary banks&#8221; which are so numerous on Dartmoor,
and are represented in Wiltshire according to Sir
R. C. Hoare; these serve for bounds and pathways, and
for connecting and enclosing fields or houses.</p>

<p>Dealing, then, with stone rows or avenues, which
may be single, double, or multiple; any which are very
long and crooked, following several directions, are certainly
not astronomical; and it is easy to see in some
cases that they might have been useful guides at night
or in mist in difficult country with streams to cross.
This possible utility must not be judged wholly by the
present conformation of the ground or the present beds
of streams.</p>

<p>For multiple avenues it is hard to find practical uses
such as the above, and we know how such avenues
were used in Brittany for sun worship. Mr. Baring
Gould considers there were eight rows in an avenue
on Challacombe Down 528 feet long; of these only
three rows remain, the others being represented by
single stones here and there (Rowe, p. 33). I shall
have something to say about this avenue further on.</p>

<p>Although, as I have said, long rows bending in
various directions are not likely to have had an astronomical
origin, it must not be assumed that all astronomical
avenues must be <i>exactly</i> straight. This, of
course, would be true for level ground, but if the
avenue has to pass over ridges and furrows, the varying<span class="pagenum" id="Page150">[150]</span>
height of the horizon must be reckoned with, and
therefore the azimuth of the avenue at any point
along it.</p>

<p>I think it possible that in the Stalldon Moor row
we have the mixture of religious and practical intention
at which I have before hinted. Both Mr. Lukis
and Mr. Hansford Worth have studied this monument,
which is two miles and a quarter long. There is a
circle at the south end about 60 feet in diameter,
while at its northern end there is a cairn.</p>

<p>Where the line starts from the circle the direction of
the row is parallel to many sight-lines in Cornwall,
and Arcturus would rise in the azimuth indicated.
But this direction is afterwards given up for one which
leads towards an important collection of hut circles, and
it crosses the Erme, no doubt at the most convenient
spot. More to the north it crosses another stream and
the bog of Red Lake. All this is surely practical
enough, although the way indicated might have been
followed by the priests of the hut circles to the stone
circle to prepare the morning sacrifice and go through
the ritual.</p>

<p>But there is still another method of discrimination.
If any of these avenues were used at all for purposes
of worship, their azimuths should agree with those
already found in connection with circles in other parts
of Britain, for we need not postulate a special race with
a special cult limited to Dartmoor; and in my inquiries
what I have to do is to consider the general question
of orientation wherever traces of it can be found. The
more the evidences coincide the better it is for the
argument, while variations afford valuable tests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page151">[151]</span></p>

<p>Now, speaking very generally (I have not yet compared
all my numerous notes), in Cornwall the chief alignments
from the circles there are with azimuths N. 10&deg;-20&deg; E.
watching the rise of the clock-star, N. 64&deg;-68&deg; E.
watching the rise of the May sun, N. 75&deg;-82&deg; E.
watching the rise of the Pleiades. The variation in
the azimuths is largely due to the different heights of
the horizon towards which the sight-lines are directed.</p>

<p>The conclusion I have come to is that these alignments,
depending upon circles and menhirs in Cornwall,
are all well represented on Dartmoor associated with
the avenues; and further, so far as I have learned at
present, in the case of the avenues connected with
circles, there are not many alignments I have not met
with in connection with circles in Cornwall and
elsewhere.</p>

<p>This is not only a <i>prima facie</i> argument in favour
of the astronomical use underlying the structures, but it
is against the burial theory, for certainly there must
have been burials in Cornwall.</p>

<p>In order, therefore, to proceed with the utmost
caution, I limit myself in the first instance to the above
azimuths, and will begin by applying a test which
should be a rigid one.</p>

<p>If the avenues on Dartmoor had to deal with the
same practices and cults as did the circles in Cornwall,
they ought to prove themselves to have been in use at
<i>about</i> the same time, and from this point of view the
investigation of the avenues becomes of very great importance,
because of the destruction of circles and
menhirs which has been going on, and is still going
on, on Dartmoor. We have circles without menhirs<span class="pagenum" id="Page152">[152]</span>
and menhirs without circles, so that the azimuths of
the avenues alone remain to give us any chance of
dating the monuments if they were used in connection
with star worship. The case is far different in Cornwall,
where both circles and menhirs have in many
cases been spared.</p>

<p>On Dartmoor, where in some cases the menhirs still
remain, they have been annexed as crosses and perhaps
as boundary stones, and squared and initialed; hence
the Ordnance surveyors have been misled, and they
are not shown as ancient stones on the map. In some
cases the azimuth of the stones suggests that this has
been the sequence of events.</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above that I have not
tackled a question full of pitfalls without due caution,
and this care was all the more necessary as the avenues
have for long been the meeting ground of the friends
and foes of what Rowe calls &#8220;Druidical speculations&#8221;;
even yet the war rages, and my writing and Lieut.
Devoir&#8217;s observing touching the similar but grander
avenues of Brittany have so far been all in vain;
chiefly, I think, because no discrimination has been
considered possible between different uses of avenues,
and because the statements made by arch&aelig;ologists as
to their direction have been quite useless to anybody in
consequence of their vagueness, and last of all because
the recent work on the Brittany remains is little known.</p>

<p>I began my acquaintance with the Dartmoor monuments
by visiting Merrivale, and the result of my
inquiries there left absolutely no doubt whatever on my
mind. I was armed, thanks to the kindness of Colonel
Johnston, the Director of the Ordnance Survey, with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page153">[153]</span>
25-inch map, while Mr. Hansford Worth had been so
good as to send me one showing his special survey.</p>

<p>The Merrivale avenues (lat. 50&deg; 33&#8242; 15&#8243;) are composed
of two double rows, roughly with the azimuth N. 82&deg; E.;
the northern row is shorter than the other. Rowe,
in his original description (1830), makes the northern
1143 feet long; they are not quite parallel, and the
southern row has a distinct &#8220;kink&#8221; or change of direction
in it at about the centre. The stones are mostly
2 or 3 feet high, and in each row they are about 3 feet
apart; the distance between the rows is about 80 feet.</p>

<p>I have before pointed out (<a href="#Page149">p. 149</a>) that an avenue
directed to the rising place of a star, if it is erected
over undulating ground, cannot be straight. I may now
mention another apparent paradox. If two avenues are
directed to the rising place of the same star <i>at
different times</i>, they cannot be parallel. It is not a
little curious that absence of parallelism has been used
against avenues having had an astronomical use!</p>

<p>Both the Ordnance surveyors and Mr. Worth have
shown the want of parallelism of the two avenues, and
Mr. Worth has noted the kink in the southern one.
The height of the horizon, as determined from my

<p>To simplify matters we may deal with the Ordnance
values and neglect the small change of direction in
the southern avenue. We have, then, the two dates
1580 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> and 1420 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> for the two avenues. The
argument for the Pleiades is strengthened by the fact
that at Athens the Hecatompedon was oriented to
these stars in 1495 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> according to Mr. Penrose&#8217;s
determination of the azimuth.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>Now this is not the first time I have referred to
avenues in these notes. The azimuth of one at Stonehenge
was used to fix the date at which sun worship
went on there. That avenue, unlike the Dartmoor
ones, was built of earth, and it is not alone. There is
another nearly two miles long called the Cursus. So
far, I have found no solstitial worship on Dartmoor,
so there are no avenues parallel to the one at Stonehenge
leading N.E. from the temple. But how about
the other? <i>It is roughly parallel to the avenues at<span class="pagenum" id="Page155">[155]</span>
Merrivale, and I think, therefore, was, like them, used
as a processional road, a via sacra, to watch the
rising of the Pleiades.</i></p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig44">

<img src="images/illo167.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="403" />

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo167lg.jpg">Larger map</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 44</span>.&mdash;Reprint of Ordnance Map showing that the Cursus at Stonehenge is
nearly parallel to the Merrivale Avenue. The azimuth is 82&deg; and not 84&deg; as
shown in the figure.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>I said roughly parallel; its azimuth is about the
same (N. 82&deg; E. roughly); but the horizon is only
about 1&deg; high; it was therefore in use before those at
Merrivale; the exact date of use must wait for theodolite
values of the height of the horizon, but in the
meantime we can see from the above estimates that
the declination of the Pleiades was about N. 5&deg; 28&#8242; 30&#8243;
and the date of use 1950 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, that is some 300 years
before the solstitial restoration.</p>

<p>Mr. Worth&#8217;s survey gives another line of stones. It is
undoubtedly, I think, an ancient line, although it is
not shown in the Ordnance map, a clear indication of<span class="pagenum" id="Page156">[156]</span>
the difficulty of discriminating these avenues on land
cumbered with stones in all directions. Its azimuth is
N. 24&deg; 25&#8242; E., and the height of the horizon 5&deg; 10&#8242;.
This gives us Arcturus at the date 1860 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, showing
that, as at the Hurlers, Arcturus was used as a clock-star.
Hence a possible <i>astronomical</i> use is evident,
while this row, like the others, could have been of no
<i>practical</i> use to anybody. It is interesting to note that
this single row of stones is older than the double
ones; this seems natural.</p>

<p>It is worth while to say a word as to the different
treatment of the ends of the south avenue now that it
seems probable that it was used to watch the rising of
the Pleiades. At the east end there is what arch&aelig;ologists
term a &#8220;blocking stone&#8221;; these observations
suggest that it was really a <i>sighting</i> stone. At the
west end such a stone is absent, but the final stones
in the avenue are longer than the rest. This may help
us in the true direction of the sight-lines in other
avenues; and, indeed, I shall show in the sequel that
this consideration affords a criterion which, in the
cases I have come across, is entirely in harmony with
others.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XVI</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE DARTMOOR AVENUES (<i>continued</i>)</span></h2>

<p>My inquiries began at Merrivale because there is a
circle associated with the avenues a little to the
south of the west end of the longest; and again nearly,
or quite, south of this there is a fine menhir, possibly
used to give a north-south line. There is another menhir
given on the Ordnance map, azimuth N. 70&deg; 30&#8242; E.,
which, with hills 3&deg; high, points out roughly the place
of sunrise from the circle in May (April 29). Although
this stone has been squared and initialed, I think I am
justified in claiming it as an ancient monument.
There is still another, azimuth N. 83&deg; E., giving a
line from the circle almost parallel to the avenue. I
hope some local arch&aelig;ologist will examine it, for if
ancient it will tell us whether the N. avenue or the
circle was built first, a point of which it is difficult to
overrate the importance, as it will show the strict
relationship between the astronomy of the avenues
and that of the circle, and we can now, I think, deal
with the astronomical use of circles after the results
obtained at Stonehenge, Stenness and the Hurlers as
an accepted fact. With the above approximate values<span class="pagenum" id="Page158">[158]</span>
the date comes out 1750 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, the declination of the
Pleiades being N. 6&deg; 35&#8242;.</p>

<p>I now pass on from Merrivale as an example of
those avenues the direction of which lies somewhere
in the E.-W. direction. Others which I have not
seen, given by Rowe, are at Assacombe, Drizzlecombe
and Trowlesworthy; to these Mr. Worth adds Harter
or Har Tor (or Black Tor).</p>

<p>The avenues which lie nearly N. and S. are more
numerous. Rowe gives the following:&mdash;Fernworthy,
Challacombe, Trowlesworthy, Stalldon Moor, Battendon,
Hook Lake, and Tristis Rock. Of these I have
visited the first two, as well as one on Shovel Down
not named by Rowe, and the next two I have studied
on the 6-inch Ordnance map.</p>

<p><i>Fernworthy</i> (lat. 50&deg; 38&#8242;).&mdash;Here are two avenues,
one with azimuth N. 15&deg; 45&#8242; E., hills 1&deg; 15&#8242;. There is a
sighting stone at the N. end. We appear to be dealing
with Arcturus as clock-star 1610 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> This is about the
date of the erection of the N. avenue at Merrivale.</p>

<p>The second avenue has its sighting stone built into a
wall at the south end. Looking south along the avenue,
the conditions are azimuth S. 8&deg; 42&#8242; W., hills 3&deg; 30&#8242;.</p>

<p>Both these avenues are aligned on points within,
but <i>not</i> at the centre of, the circle.</p>

<p><i>Challacombe</i> (lat. 50&deg; 36&#8242;).&mdash;This is a case of a
triple avenue, probably the remains of eight rows, in
a depression between two hills, Challacombe Down
and Warrington. There is no circle. The azimuth is
23&deg; 37&#8242; N.W. or S.E., according to direction. The
northern end has been destroyed by an old stream
work; there is no blocking stone to the south on<span class="pagenum" id="Page159">[159]</span>
either of the remaining avenues, but one large menhir
terminates one row of stones. The
others may have been removed. So
it is probable that the alignment
was to the north. If so, we are dealing
with the setting of Arcturus,
warning the summer solstice sunrise
in 1860 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> To the S. the hills
are 4&deg; 48&#8242;, to the N. 4&deg; 50&#8242;.</p>

<p>To this result some importance
must be attached, first, because it
brings us into presence of the cult
of the solstitial year, secondly, because
it shows us that the system
most in vogue in Brittany was introduced
in relation to that year.
In Brittany, as I have before shown,
the complicated alignments, there
are 11 parallel rows at Le M&eacute;nac
(<a href="#Page99">p. 99</a>) (there <i>were</i> 8 parallel rows
at Challacombe), were set up to
watch the May and August sunrises,
and the solstitial alignments
came afterwards. The Brittany
May alignments, therefore, were probably
used long before 1860 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,
the date we have found for Challacombe,
where not the sunrise
but the setting star which gave
warning of it was observed.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig45">

<img src="images/illo171.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="107" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 45</span>.&mdash;The remains of the eight rows
of the Challacombe Avenue. Looking North of East. Terminal Menhir on
the extreme right.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>It is worth while to point out that
at Challacombe, as elsewhere, the priest-astronomers so<span class="pagenum" id="Page160">[160]</span>
located their monuments that the nearly circumpolar stars
which were so useful to them should rise over an horizon
of some angular height. In this way the direction-lines
would be available for a longer period of time, for
near the north point the change of azimuth with change
in the declination of the star observed is very rapid.</p>

<p><i>Shovel Down</i>, near Batworthy (lat. 50&deg; 39&#8242; 20&#8243;).&mdash;A
group of five rows of stones, four double, one single,
with two sets of azimuths.</p>

<p>One set gives az. 22&deg; 25&deg;, and 28&deg;. They seem to
be associated. I will call them A, B, and C. A is
directed to the circle on Godleigh Common. Its ends
are free. B is a single line of stones to the E. of the
triple circle, about which more presently. It is not
marked on the Ordnance map; its ends are also free.
C has its south end blocked, I think in later times,
by a kistvaen. The astronomical direction may be,
therefore, either N.W. or S.E. We find a probable use
in the N.W. quadrant, as at Challacombe, Arcturus
setting at daybreak as a warner of the summer solstice.</p>

<p>Adjacent to A, B, C, is another avenue, which I
will call D. Unlike the others, its northern end points
2&deg; E. of N. Its southern end is blocked by a remarkable
triple circle, the end of the avenue close to it being
defined by two tall terminal stones. We are justified,
then, in thinking that its orientation was towards the
north; the height of the horizon I measured as 45&#8242;. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page161">[161]</span>
may have been an attempt to mark the N. point of the
horizon.</p>

<p>The triple circle to which I have referred is not an
ordinary circle. I believe it to be a later added, much
embellished, cairn. According to Ormerod, the diameters
are 26, 20, and 3 feet, and there are three small stones
at the centre.</p>

<p>All the above avenues are on the slope of the hill to the
north. On the south slope we find the longest of all, as
shown on the Ordnance map survey of 1885. There
is a &#8220;long stone&#8221; in its centre, and at the southern
end was formerly a cromlech, the &#8220;three boys.&#8221; Part of
this avenue, and two of the three &#8220;boys,&#8221; have been
taken to build a wall. The long stone remains, because
it is a boundary stone!</p>

<p>The azimuth is 2&deg; 30&#8242; W. of north or E. of south.
Looking N. from the long stone, the height of the
horizon is 2&deg; 30&#8242;. I think this avenue was an attempt
to mark the S. point.</p>

<p><i>Trowlesworthy</i> (lat. 50&deg; 27&#8242; 30&#8243;).&mdash;The remains here are
most interesting. This is the only monument on Dartmoor
in which I have so far traced any attempt
to locate the sun&#8217;s place at rising either for the May
or solstitial year. But I will deal with the N.-S.
avenue first, as it is this feature which associates it
with Fernworthy and Challacombe.</p>

<p>As at Merrivale, the avenue has a decided &#8220;kink&#8221;
or change of direction. The facts as gathered from the
6-inch map are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

From the Ordnance map.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>This date is very nearly that of the use of the S.
circle at the Hurlers, and it is early for Dartmoor; but
it is quite possible that local observations on an
associated avenue a little to the west of the circle
which terminates the N.-S. avenue will justify it.
This is not far from parallel to that at Merrivale, but
its northern azimuth is greater, so that if it turns out to
have been aligned on the Pleiades its date will be some
time before that of Merrivale, that is, before 1580 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
I can say nothing more about it till I have visited it.</p>

<p>The new features to which I have referred are two<span class="pagenum" id="Page163">[163]</span>
tumuli which in all probability represent more recent
additions to the original scheme of observation, as we
have found at Stenness, and show that Trowlesworthy
was for long one of the chief centres of worship on
Dartmoor. Their azimuths are S. 64&deg; E. and S. 49&deg; W.,
dealing, therefore, with the May year sunrises in
November and February and the solstitial sunset in
December. It is probable that, as at the Hurlers,
tumuli were used instead of stones not earlier than
1900 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p><i>Stalldon Moor</i> (lat. 50&deg; 27&#8242; 45&#8243;) I have already
incidentally referred to. The azimuth of the stone
row as it leaves the circle, <i>not</i> from its centre as I
read the 6-inch map, is N. 3&deg; E.; as the azimuth gradually
increases for a time, we may be dealing with
Arcturus, but local observation is necessary.</p>

<p>The differences between the Cornish and Dartmoor
monuments give much food for thought, and it is to
be hoped that they will be carefully studied by future
students of orientation, as so many questions are
suggested. I will refer to some of them.</p>

<p>(1) Are the avenues, chiefly consisting of two rows of
stones, a reflection of the sphinx avenues of Egypt?
and, if so, how can the intensification of them on
Dartmoor be explained?</p>

<p>(2) Was there a double worship going on in the
avenues and the circles at the same time? If not, why
were the former not aligned on the circles? On a dead
level, of course, if the avenues were aligned on the
centre of the circle towards the rising or setting of the
sun or a star, the procession in the <i>via sacra</i> would
block the view of those in the circle. We have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page164">[164]</span>
avenue at Stonehenge undoubtedly aligned on the centre
of the circle, but there the naos was on an eminence,
so that the procession in the avenue was always below
the level of the horizon, and so did not block the
view.</p>

<p>(3) Do all the cairns and cists in the avenues represent
later additions, so late, indeed, that they may
have been added after the avenues had ceased to be
used for ceremonial purposes? The cairn at nearly
the central point of the S. avenue at Merrivale was
certainly not there as a part of the structure when the
avenue was first used as a <i>via sacra</i> for observing the
rising of the Pleiades. I have always held that these
ancient temples, and even their attendant long and
chambered barrows, were for the living and not for the
dead, and this view has been strengthened by what I
have observed on Dartmoor.</p>

<p>There was good reason for burials after the sacred
nature of the spot had been established, and they may
have taken place at any time since; the most probable
time being after 1000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> up to a date as recent as
arch&aelig;ologists may consider probable.</p>

<p>Mr. Worth, whose long labours on the Dartmoor
avenues give such importance to his opinions, objects
to the astronomical use of those avenues because there
are so many of them; he informs me that he knows
of 50; I think this objection may be considered less
valid if the avenues show that they were dedicated
to different uses, some practical and others sacred, at
different times of the year. For instance, Challacombe
is not a duplicate of Merrivale; one is solstitial, the
other deals with the May year; and a complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page165">[165]</span>
examination of them&mdash;I have only worked on the fringe&mdash;may
show other differences having the same bearing.</p>

<p>In favour of the astronomical view it must be borne
in mind that the results obtained in Devon and Cornwall
are remarkably similar, and the dates are roughly
the same. Among the whole host of heaven from
which objectors urge it is free for me to select any
star I choose, at present only six stars have been considered,
two of which were certainly used, as in Egypt,
as clock-stars as they just dipped below the northern
horizon, and other two afterwards at Athens; and these
six stars are shown by nothing more recondite than an
inspection of a precessional globe to have been precisely
the stars, the &#8220;morning stars,&#8221; wanted by the priest-astronomers
who wished to be prepared for the instant
of sunrise at the critical points of the May or solstitial
year.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XVII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">STANTON DREW (Lat. 51&deg; 10&#8242; N.)</span></h2>

<p>Other circles to which I have given some attention
are at Stanton Drew in Somerset. I regret to say
that I have not as yet had an opportunity of visiting
them. But a cursory inspection on the Ordnance map
of the possible sight-lines from circle to circle, for
there are three, suggested at once that we were dealing
with the same problem as that worked out, if somewhat
differently, at the Hurlers.</p>

<p>The three circles, two avenues leading from two
of the circles towards the river, and some outstanding
stones were most carefully surveyed by
Mr. C. E. Dymond some years ago. He was good
enough to send me copies of his plans and levelling
sections. I have not had the advantage of perusing
his memoir, but I have studied the monuments as
well as I could by means of the 25-inch Ordnance
map. This, combined with an azimuth which Colonel
Johnston, the Director-General of the Ordnance Survey,
was kind enough to send me, should give me bearings
within a degree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page167">[167]</span></p>

<p>I will begin by giving a short account of the stones
which remain, abridged from the convenient pamphlet
prepared for the British Association meeting at Bristol
in 1898 by Prof. Lloyd Morgan.</p>

<p>The circles at Stanton Drew, though far less imposing
than those of Avebury and Stonehenge, are thought to
be more ancient than are the latter, for the rough-hewn
uprights and plinths of Stonehenge bear the
marks of a higher and presumably later stage of
mechanical development. Taken as a group, the
Somersetshire circles are in some respects more complex
than their better known rivals in Wiltshire.
There are three circles, from two of which &#8220;avenues&#8221;
proceed for a short distance in a more or less easterly
direction; there is a shattered but large dolmen&mdash;if we
may so regard the set of stones called &#8220;the cove&#8221;;
and there are outlying stones&mdash;the &#8220;quoit,&#8221; and those
in Middle Ham&mdash;which bear such relations to the
circles as to suggest that they too formed parts of
some general scheme of construction.</p>

<p>From the photograph of the Ordnance map (<a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a>)
it will be seen, as pointed out by Prof. Lloyd Morgan,</p>

<p>(1) That the centre of the great circle, that of the
S.W. circle, and that of the quoit, are nearly in the
same straight line.</p>

<p>(2) That the cove, the centre of the great circle,
and that of the N.E. circle, are nearly in the same
straight line.</p>

<p>The quoit, which generally means the covering
stone of a cromlech&mdash;&#8220;Hautville&#8217;s Quoit,&#8221; as it is
named on the Ordnance map&mdash;looms large in Stanton
Drew tradition; it is locally as much respected as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page168">[168]</span>
circles themselves. It is pointed to most unmistakably
by the fact that a line from it to the S.W. circle
passes nearly through the centre of the great circle.</p>

<p>If the observation line, then, meant anything
astronomically, it can only have had to do with the
rising of a star far to the north, in a position far more
northerly than the sun ever reaches.</p>

<p>The &#8220;quoit,&#8221; lying in an orchard by the roadside,
has nothing very impressive about its appearance&mdash;a
recumbent mass of greyish sandstone; but it seems to
be a brick in the Stanton Drew building. By some
regarded as a sarsen block from Wiltshire, it is, in
Prof. Lloyd Morgan&#8217;s opinion, more probably derived
from the Old Red Sandstone of Mendip. In any case
it is not, geologically speaking, <i>in situ</i>; nor has it
reached its present position by natural agency.</p>

<p>With regard to two of the megalithic circles, at first
sight the constituent stones seem irregularly dotted
about the field; but as we approach them the unevenly
spaced stones group themselves.</p>

<p>The material of which the greater number of the
rude blocks is composed is peculiar and worthy of
careful examination. It is a much altered rock consisting,
in most of the stones, of an extremely hard
siliceous breccia with angular fragments embedded in a
red or deep brown matrix, and with numerous cavities
which give it a rough slaggy appearance. Many of
these hollows are coated internally with a jasper-like
material, the central cavity being lined with gleaming
quartz-crystals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page170">[170]</span></p>

<p>The majority of the stones were probably brought
from Harptree Ridge on Mendip, distant some six
miles. Weathered blocks of Triassic breccia, showing
various stages of silicification, there lie on the surface;
and there probably lay the weathered monoliths which
have been transported to Stanton Drew. It is important
to note that they were erected unhewn and
untouched by the tool. A few stones are of other
material&mdash;sandstone, like the &#8220;quoit,&#8221; or oolite from
Dundry.</p>

<p>In the great circle, of the visible stones some retain
their erect position, others are recumbent, several are
partially covered by accumulation of grass-grown soil.
Others are completely buried, their position being revealed
in dry seasons by the withering of the grass
above them.</p>

<p>To the east of this circle a short avenue leads out,
there being three visible stones and one buried block
on the one hand, and two visible stones on the other.
But one&#8217;s attention is apt to be diverted from these to
the very large and massive megaliths of the small N.E.
circle. This is composed of eight weathered masses,
one of which (if indeed it do not represent more than
one), Prof. Lloyd Morgan tells us, is recumbent and
shattered. From this circle, all the stones of which
are of the siliceous breccia, a short avenue of small
stones also opens out eastwards.</p>

<p>The third or S.W. circle lies at some little distance
from the others. The average size of the stones is
smaller than in either of the other circles, and not all
are composed of the same material.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Cove,&#8221; which has been variously regarded as a
dolmen, a druidical chair of state, and a shelter for
sacrificial fire, is close to the church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page171">[171]</span></p>

<p>As I was not able to visit Stanton Drew when the
significance of the northerly alignments struck me, I
made an appeal to Prof. Lloyd Morgan, of whose
pamphlet I have so largely made use, to obtain some
theodolite observations. As a result such observations
have been made by himself and Mr. Morrow, from
whom I have recently received a report with full
permission to make use of it in this place.</p>

<p>The monuments are not easy to measure, as the
centres of the circles are not readily determined, as so
many of the stones are either absent, recumbent or
buried.</p>

<p>In my rough reading of the Ordnance map given
in <a href="#Fig47">Fig. 47</a>, I thought I might be guided by taking
centres, such that the avenues would be aligned on
them as at Stonehenge. I had not then seen the
Dartmoor avenues, which in some cases are not
aligned on the centres. In this it is possible that I
was wrong, as both Mr. Dymond&#8217;s and Mr. Morrow&#8217;s
observations suggest that the avenues are really of the
Dartmoor pattern. Mr. Morrow writes: &#8220;The centres
of the circles are (to a certain small extent) a matter
of choice, a difference of a few minutes may easily
occur. In dealing with the avenues a larger discrepancy
may occur. I have taken what, in my
opinion, was the best centre line of each avenue and<span class="pagenum" id="Page172">[172]</span>
thus determined its azimuth. But I believe that
originally the southern line of stones forming each
avenue was directed towards the centre of the corresponding
circle, and that the avenue was then completed
by the erection of a parallel line of stones. A
difference of a few degrees may thus be accounted for
in the azimuth supposed to have been originally
marked out.&#8221;</p>

<p>About Mr. Morrow&#8217;s azimuths there can be no
question. He writes:</p>

<p>&#8220;The instruments used were, first, a 6&#8243; theodolite,
and second, a 6&#8243; transit theodolite. The final results
were obtained with the latter. It cannot be reversed
when measuring elevations. I tested it very carefully
for the adjustments of (<i>a</i>) line of collimation at right
angles to the horizontal axis, (<i>b</i>) horizontal axis perpendicular
to vertical axis, and (<i>c</i>) line of collimation
and spirit level parallel to each other. The instrument
was in first-rate order, the error in elevation, for
example, being within that corresponding to a slope of
1 in 40,000; that is well within the limit of 20&#8243; to
which vertical angles can be read.</p>

<p>&#8220;The meridian was obtained by two different methods
applied several times, the results agreeing very closely.
Readings of azimuths and altitude of sun were taken
between three and four hours after noon, corrected
for semi-diameter, &amp;c., and the true bearing obtained
with the aid of the latitude and the declination given
in Nautical Almanac (corrected for time).</p>

<p>&#8220;With regard to the elevations of the horizon, the
existence of trees on or just below the sky-line renders
readings to the nearest minute uncertain. In all cases<span class="pagenum" id="Page173">[173]</span>
I have tried to give the most probable value, supposing
the trees to be absent. In some places the heights
will have altered slightly during recent years owing
to the construction of railways.</p>

<p>&#8220;The values given are the means of observations.
They are not corrected for height of instrument above
ground, which might increase the angles by about
5 mins. Trees on the sky-line appear to make a
difference of some 35 mins.&#8221;</p>

are as under:</p>

<p>One of the greatest differences between Mr. Morrow&#8217;s
local observation and my reading of the 25-inch
Ordnance map occurs in the case of the direction of
the avenue from the great circle. It may be suggested
that the use of this avenue was to observe the May
and August sunrises of the May year. If we take the
sun&#8217;s declination at 16&deg; 20&#8242; N., see <a href="#Page22">p. 22</a>, the azimuth
should be about N. 64&deg; E.; this is 1&deg; from my value and
5&deg; from that given by Mr. Morrow, but it must not
be forgotten that the choice of a day in May and
August slightly differing from the normal date might
easily produce such a variation.</p>

<p>It seems probable that the great circle was one of
the first erected, and the fact that, like Stonehenge,
it had an avenue, but that, unlike Stonehenge,
the avenue was directed towards the May and not
the June (solstitial) sunrise further, I think, suggests
that the May worship was considered the most important
and was the first provided for.</p>

<p>There is reason for supposing that the great circle
was at all events built before the S.W. one. The
great circle is situated at a lower level than the S.W.
one. The angular elevation of the hills over which
Arcturus rose would appear, therefore, to be higher
from the great than from the S.W. circle. Arcturus
has been reducing its declination for centuries in consequence
of the precessional movement. It would<span class="pagenum" id="Page175">[175]</span>
therefore rise gradually in a greater azimuth, that is,
nearer the east. An observer in the centre of the
great circle, to follow this more easterly rising over
the quoit, would have to change his position gradually
to the westward. But there was another way. The
original direction could be nearly maintained if the
observation were made at a higher level near the
original line, as then the relative elevation of the rising-place
would be reduced.</p>

<p>This is what possibly was done, and this indeed may
be the <i>vera causa</i> of the building of the S.W. circle.</p>

<p>This view of the possible function of the &#8220;quoit&#8221; is,
of course, strengthened by the fact that we find traces
of high northerly alignment in other stone circles. I
have already shown that there are such alignments in
Cornwall.</p>

<p>The &#8220;quoit&#8221; is nearly on a level with the great circle,
while the hills rise behind it. It has been suggested
that it would have been more useful on the top of the
hill, but this suggestion cannot be accepted for a moment
if it were used in the way I have indicated. On a
dark night it would have been invisible, and it also
would have prevented the observation of star-rise if it
were truly aligned. Being comparatively near the circle
it could easily have been illuminated at the critical
time, and thus have anticipated the bright line micrometer
of more modern times.</p>

<p>So far I have found no obvious use for the avenue
attached to the N.E. circle. The conditions are:</p>

<p>As Mr. Morrow states, the choice of centre of the
circle may alter the azimuth obtained by as much as
&#8220;a few degrees,&#8221; but the value obtained from the
Ordnance map is, definitely, N. 51&deg; E., and with the height
of hills determined by Mr. Morrow this would suggest
that the N.E. circle was really erected to provide the
alignment, from the centre of the great circle, or from
the Cove, to the summer solstitial sun, about the year
870 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, Stockwell&#8217;s values for the obliquity being taken.
This result is the more striking as it gives a date for
the substitution of the June for the May worship at
Stanton Drew, which is in full accordance with that
obtained for the similar change at Stenness.</p>

<p>There is other evidence, to which I attach importance,
as it deals with a method and policy found in many
temple fields in Egypt, that of blocking the alignment
of an older star- or sun-cult, which the astronomer-priests
replaced by their own. The stones of the avenue
of the solstitial N.E. circle I expect once blocked the May
sunrise line from the great circle; judging from the
Ordnance map, and remembering the number of stones
that have disappeared, this is probable if not certain.</p>

<p>If this were so, then the N.E. circle was the last to
be erected, and this suggestion is strengthened by Mr.
Lewis&#8217;s statement that it is the most perfect of the
three.</p>

<p>Prof. Lloyd Morgan concludes his interesting account<span class="pagenum" id="Page177">[177]</span>
of which I have made so much use with the following
remarks:</p>

<p>&#8220;In what order the circles were constructed we do
not know. Whether the small N.E. circle with its more
massive megaliths preceded or succeeded the great circle
with its more numerous but, on the average, less massive
stones, is a matter of mere conjecture. They may
have been contemporaneous: but it is more likely that
so large a work took a long time in execution; nor
does the unity of plan of the final product preclude a
gradual process of development. Finally as to the
purpose of the erection, and its hidden astronomical,
mythological, or social meaning (if it have one), we are
once more at the mercy of more or less plausible conjecture.
There stand the circles in a quiet Somersetshire
valley, silent memorials of a race concerning whose
modes of life, of labour, and of thought we can but
speculate.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that before the monument has disappeared
like so many of its fellows, some student with
more knowledge and time to devote to the inquiry than
myself will endeavour to answer more of the questions
raised by it.</p>

<hr class="footnote" />

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote23"></a><a href="#FNanchor23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a>
With regard to these values Mr. Morrow writes: &#8220;At present
Hauteville&#8217;s quoit is not visible from the centre of great circle.
If the stone were erect, however, and any intervening trees and walls
removed, the top of the stone would no doubt be within view. The
Hauteville quoit line is thus rather a difficult one to obtain with
accuracy, but the azimuth given should be correct to the nearest
minute.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XVIII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">FOLKLORE AND TRADITION</span></h2>

<p>We have so far considered the circles at Stonehenge,
Stenness, the Hurlers and Stanton Drew, and the avenues
in Brittany and on Dartmoor. Before I refer to my later
work in the south-west of England or attempt to present
a summary of the results of the inquiry, I think it will
be convenient to turn for a time to another branch of it,
for that there is another closely connected series of facts to
be considered in relation to the monuments folklore and
tradition abundantly prove.</p>

<p>So far in this book I have dealt chiefly with stones&mdash;as
I hold, associated with, or themselves composing, sanctuaries.
We have become acquainted with circles, menhirs,
dolmens, altars, vi&aelig; sacr&aelig;, various structures built
up of stones. Barrows and earthern banks represented
them later.</p>

<p>The view which I have been led to bring forward so far
is that these structures had in one way or another to do
with the worship of the sun and stars; that they had for
the most part an astronomical use in connection with
religious ceremonials.</p>

<p>The next question which concerns us in an attempt to<span class="pagenum" id="Page179">[179]</span>
get at the bottom of the matter is to see whether there
are any concomitant phenomena, and, if there be any, to
classify them and study the combined results.</p>

<p>Tradition and folklore, which give dim references to the
ancient uses of the stones, show in most unmistakable
fashion that the stones were not alone; associated with
them almost universally were many practices referred to
on <a href="#Page26">p. 26</a>, such as the lighting of fires, passing through
them, and dancing round them; in the neighbourhood of
the stones and associated with the fire practices were also
sacred trees and sacred wells or streams.</p>

<p>Folklore and tradition not only thus may help us, but
I think they will be helped by such a general survey,
brief though it must be. So far as my reading has gone
each special tradition has been considered by itself; there
has been no general inquiry having for its object the study
of the possible origin and <i>connection</i> of many of the
ancient practices and ideas which have so dimly come
down to us in many cases and which we can only completely
reconstruct by piecing together the information
derived from various sources.</p>

<p>I now propose to refer to all these matters with the
view of seeing whether there be any relation between
practices apparently disconnected in so many cases if we
follow the literature in which they are chronicled. We
must not blame the literature, since the facts which remain
to be recorded now here, now there, are but a small
fraction of those that have been forgotten. Fortunately,
the practices forgotten in one locality have been remembered
in another, so that it is possible the picture can be restored
more completely than one might have thought at first.</p>

<p>It will be seen at once that from the point of view with<span class="pagenum" id="Page180">[180]</span>
which we are at present concerned, one of the chief relations
we must look for is that of time, seeing that my
chief affirmation with regard to the stone monuments is
that they were used for ceremonial purposes at certain
seasons, those seasons being based first upon the agricultural,
and later upon the astronomical divisions of the year,
to which I drew attention in <a href="#Page17">Chapter III.</a> In <a href="#Page25">Chapter IV.</a>,
when referring to the agricultural and astronomical new
years&#8217; days, I indicated a possible relation between the
temple worship and the floral celebrations of that time,
and later on (<a href="#Page40">p. 40</a>), in connection with the monuments
in Brittany, I pointed out the coincidence of fire customs
at the same time of the year.</p>

<p>But in a matter of this kind it will not do to depend
upon isolated cases; the general trend of all the facts
available along several lines of inquiry must be found and
studied, first separately and then <i>inter se</i>, if any final
conclusion is to be reached.</p>

<p>This is what I now propose to do in a very summary
manner. It is not my task to arrange the facts of folklore
and tradition, but simply to cull from the available
sources precise statements which bear upon the questions
before us. These statements, I think, may be accepted as
trustworthy, and all the more so as many of the various
recorders have had no idea either of the existence of a May
year at all or of the connection between the different
classes of the phenomena which ought to exist if my
theory of their common origin in connection with ancient
worship and the monuments is anywhere near the truth.</p>

<p>This question of time relations is surrounded by difficulties.</p>

<p>I gave in <a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a> the Gregorian dates of the beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page181">[181]</span>
of the quarters of the May year, if nothing but the sun&#8217;s
declination of 16&deg; 20&#8242; N. or S., four times in its yearly
path, be considered. These <span class="nowrap">were:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>In the table I also give, for comparison, the dates in the
Greek and Roman calendars (<a href="#Page20">p. 20</a>).</p>

<p>There is no question that on or about the above days
festivals were anciently celebrated in these islands; possibly
not all at all holy places, but some at one and some at
another; this, perhaps, may help to explain the variation
in the local traditions and even some of the groupings
of orientations.</p>

<p>The earliest information on this point comes from
Ireland.</p>

<p>Cormac, Archbishop of Cashel in the tenth century,
states, according to Vallancey, that &#8220;in his time four
great fires were lighted up on the four great festivals
of the Druids, viz., in February, May, August and
November.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote24" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor24">[24]</a></p>

<p>I am not aware of any such general statement as early
as this in relation to the four festivals of the May year
in Great Britain, but in spite of its absence the fact
is undoubted that festivals were held, and many various
forms of celebration used, during those months.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page182">[182]</span></p>

<p>From the introduction of Christianity attempts of
different kinds were made to destroy this ancient time
system and to abolish the so-called &#8220;pagan&#8221; worships
and practices connected with it. Efforts were made to
change the date and so obliterate gradually the old
traditions; another way, and this turned out to be the
more efficacious, was to change the venue of the festival,
so to speak, in favour of some Christian celebration or
saint&#8217;s day. The old festivals took no account of week-days,
so it was ruled that the festivals were to take
place on the first day of the week; later on some of
them were ruled to begin on the first day of the
month.</p>

<p>When Easter became a movable feast, the efforts of
the priests were greatly facilitated, and indeed it would
seem as if this result of such a change was not absent
from the minds of those who favoured it.</p>

<p>The change of style was, as I have before stated, a
fruitful source of confusion, and this was still further
complicated by another difficulty. Piers<a href="#Footnote25" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor25">[25]</a> tells us that
consequent upon the change &#8220;the Roman Catholics light
their fires by the new style, as the correction originated
from a pope; and for that very same reason the
Protestants adhere to the old.&#8221;</p>

<p>I will refer to each of the festivals and their changes
of date.</p>

<h3><i>February 4.</i></h3>

<p>Before the movable Easter the February festival had
been transformed into Ash Wednesday (February 4).
The eve of the festival was Shrove Tuesday, and it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page183">[183]</span>
quite possible that the ashes used by the priests on
Wednesday were connected with the bonfires of the
previous night.</p>

<p>It would seem that initially the festival, with its
accompanying bonfire, was transferred to the first
Sunday in Lent, February 8.</p>

<p>I quote the following from <span class="nowrap">Hazlitt<a id="FNanchor26"></a><a href="#Footnote26"
class="fnanchor">[26]</a>:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Durandus, in his &#8216;Rationale,&#8217; tells us, Lent was
counted to begin on that which is now the first Sunday
in Lent, and to end on Easter Eve; which time, saith
he, containing forty-two days, if you take out of them
the six Sundays (on which it was counted not lawful
at any time of the year to fast), then there will remain
only thirty-six days: and, therefore, that the number
of days which Christ fasted might be perfected, Pope
Gregory added to Lent four days of the week before-going,
viz., that which we now call Ash Wednesday,
and the three days following it. So that we see the
first observation of Lent began from a superstitious,
unwarrantable, and indeed profane, conceit of imitating
Our Saviour&#8217;s miraculous abstinence. Lent is so called
from the time of the year wherein it is observed: Lent
in the Saxon language signifying Spring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Whether this be the origin of the lenten fast or not
it is certain that the connection thus established between
an old pagan feast and a new Christian one is
very ingenious: 24 days in February plus 22 days in
March (March 22 being originally the fixed date for
Easter) gives us 46 days (6 &times; 7) + 4, and from the point
of view of priestcraft the result was eminently satisfactory,
for thousands of people still light fires on<span class="pagenum" id="Page184">[184]</span>
Shrove Tuesday or on the first Sunday of Lent, whether
those days occur in February or March. They are
under the impression that they are doing homage to a
church festival, and the pagan origin is entirely forgotten
not only by them but even by those who
chronicle the practices as &#8220;Lent customs.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote27" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor27">[27]</a></p>

<p>Finally, after the introduction of the movable Easter,
the priests at Rome, instead of using the &#8220;pagan&#8221; ashes
produced on the eve of the first Sunday in Lent or Ash
Wednesday in each year, utilised those derived from
the burning of the palms used on Palm Sunday of the
year before.</p>

<p>Further steps were taken to conceal from future
generations the origin of the &#8220;pagan&#8221; custom due on
February 4. February 3 was dedicated to St. &#8220;Blaze.&#8221;
How well this answered is shown by the following
quotation from Percy.<a href="#Footnote28" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor28">[28]</a> &#8220;The anniversary of St. Blazeus
is the 3rd February, when it is still the custom in
many parts of England to light up fires on the hills on
St. Blayse night: <i>a custom antiently taken up perhaps
for no better reason than the jingling resemblance of
his name to the word Blaze</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>This even did not suffice. A great candle church festival
was established on February 2. This was called &#8220;Candlemas,&#8221;
and Candlemas is still the common name of the
beginning of the Scotch legal year. In the Cathedral of
Durham when Cosens was bishop he &#8220;busied himself from
two of the clocke in the afternoone till foure, in climbing
long ladders to stick up wax candles in the said Cathedral
Church; the number of all the candles burnt that evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page185">[185]</span>
was 220, besides 16 torches; 60 of those burning tapers
and torches standing upon and near the high altar.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote29" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor29">[29]</a></p>

<p>There is evidence that the pagan fires at other times of
the year were also gradually replaced by candles in the
churches.</p>

<h3><i>May 6.</i></h3>

<p>The May festival has been treated by the Church in the
same way as the February one. With a fixed Easter Sunday
on March 22, 46 days after brought us to a Thursday
(May 7), hence Holy Thursday<a href="#Footnote30" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor30">[30]</a> and Ascension Day. With
Easter movable there of course was more confusion. Whit
Sunday, the Feast of Pentecost, was only nine days after
Holy Thursday, and it occurred, in some years, on the
same day of the month as Ascension Day in others. In
Scotland the festival now is ascribed to Whit Sunday.</p>

<p>It is possibly in consequence of this that the festival
before even the change of style was held on the 1st of the
month.</p>

<p>In Cornwall, where the celebrations still survive, the
day chosen is May 8.</p>

<h3><i>August 8.</i></h3>

<p>For the migrations of the dates of the &#8220;pagan&#8221; festival
in the beginning of August from the 1st to the 12th,
migrations complicated by the old and new style, I refer to<span class="pagenum" id="Page186">[186]</span>
Prof. Rhys&#8217; Hibbert Lectures, p. 418, in which work a full
account of the former practices in Ireland and Wales is
given. The old festival in Ireland was associated with
Lug, a form of the Sun-God; the most celebrated one was
held at Tailetin. This feast&mdash;Lugnassad&mdash;was changed
into the church celebration Lammas, from A.S. hl&#8217;&aacute;fmaesse&mdash;that
is loaf-mass or bread-mass, so named as a mass or
feast of thanksgiving for the first fruits of the corn harvest.
The old customs in Wales and the Isle of Alan included
the ascent of hills in the early morning, but so far I have
found no record of fires in connection with this date.<a href="#Footnote31" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor31">[31]</a></p>

<h3><i>November 8.</i></h3>

<p>The facts that November 11 is quarter day in Scotland,
that mayors are elected on or about that date, show, I think,
pretty clearly that we are here dealing with the old
&#8220;pagan&#8221; date.</p>

<p>The fact that the Church anticipated it by the feast of
All Souls&#8217; on November 1 reminds us of what happened
in the case of the February celebration; later I give a
reference to the change of date; and perhaps this date
was also determined by the natural gravitation to the first
of the month, as in the case of May, and because it marked
at one time the beginning of the Celtic year.</p>

<p>But what seems quite certain is that the feast which
should have been held on November 8 on astronomical
grounds was first converted by the Church into the
feast of St. Martin on November 11. The <i>Encyclop&aelig;dia
Britannica</i> tells us: &#8220;The feast of St. Martin
(Martinmas) took the place of an old pagan festival,<span class="pagenum" id="Page187">[187]</span>
and inherited some of its usages, such as the Martinsm&auml;nnchen,
Martinsfeuer, Martinshorn, and the like, in
various parts of Germany.&#8221;</p>

<p>St. Martin lived about <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 300. As the number of
saints increased, it became impossible to dedicate a
feast-day to each. Hence it was found expedient to
have an annual aggregate commemoration of such as
had not special days for themselves. So a church
festival &#8220;All Hallows,&#8221; or &#8220;Hallowmass,&#8221; was instituted
about <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 610 in memory of the martyrs, and it was
to take place on May 1. For some reason or another
this was changed in <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 834; May was given up,
and the date fixed as November 1. This was a commemoration
of all the saints, so we get the new name
&#8220;All Saints&#8217; Day.&#8221;</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the intention of the
Church was to anticipate, and therefore gradually to
obliterate the pagan festival still held at Martinmas,
and it has been successful in many places. In Ireland,
for instance; at Samhain,<a href="#Footnote32" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor32">[32]</a> November 1, &#8220;the proper
time for prophecy and the unveiling of mysteries.&#8221;...
It was then that fire was lighted at a place called
after Mog Ruith&#8217;s daughter Tlachtga. From Tlachtga
all the hearths in Ireland are said to have been
annually supplied, just as the Lemnians had once a
year to put their fires out and light them anew
from that brought in the sacred ship from Delos. The
habit of celebrating <i>Nos Galan-galaf</i> in Wales by
lighting bonfires on the hills is possibly not yet extinct.</p>

<p>Here, then, we find the pagan fires transferred from
the 8th to the 1st of November in Ireland, but in<span class="pagenum" id="Page188">[188]</span>
the Isle of Man this is not so. I will anticipate
another reference to Rhys by stating that Martinmas
had progressed from the 11th to the 24th before the
change of style brought it back, &#8220;old Martinmas,&#8221;
November 24, being one of the best recognised &#8220;old
English holidays,&#8221; &#8220;old Candlemas&#8221; being another, at
the other end of the May year; this last had slipped
from February 2 to February 15 before it was put
back again.</p>

<p>With regard to the Isle of Man Rhys writes<a href="#Footnote33" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor33">[33]</a> that
the feast is there called Hollantide, and is kept on
November 12, a reckoning which he states &#8220;is according
to the old style.&#8221; The question is, are we not dealing
here with the Martinmas festival <i>not</i> antedated to
November 1? He adds, &#8220;that is the day when the
tenure of land terminates, and when serving men go
to their places. In other words it is the beginning
of a new year.&#8221; This is exactly what happens in
Scotland, and the day is still called Martinmas.</p>

<p>There is a custom in mid-England which strikingly
reminds us of the importance of Martinmas in relation
to old tenures, if even the custom does not carry us
still further back. This is the curious and interesting
ceremony of collecting the wroth silver, due and
payable to his Grace the Duke of Buccleuch and
Queensbury on &#8220;Martinmas Eve.&#8221; The payment is
made on an ancient mound on the summit of Knightlow
Hill, about five miles out of Coventry, and in the
parish of Ryton-on-Dunsmore. One feature about this
singular ceremonial is that it must take place before
sun-rising.</p>

Much confusion has arisen with regard to the Holy Thursday in
Rogation week because there is another Holy or Maundy Thursday
in Easter week. Arch&aelig;ologists have also been often misled by the
practice of many writers of describing the May festivals as midsummer
festivals. The first of May, of course, marked the beginning of
summer.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XIX</span><br />
<span class="h2name">SACRED FIRES</span></h2>

<p>The magnificent collection of facts bearing on this
subject which has been brought together by Mr. Frazer
in <i>The Golden Bough</i> renders it unnecessary for me
to deal with the details of this part of my subject at
any great length.</p>

<p>We have these records of <span class="nowrap">fires:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) In February, May, August and November of the
original May year.</p>

<p>(2) In June and December on the longest and shortest
days of the solstitial year, concerning which there
could not be, and has not been, any such change of date
as has occurred in relation to the May year festivals.</p>

<p>(3) A fire at Easter, in all probability added not long
before or at the introduction of Christianity. I find no
traces of a fire festival at the corresponding equinox
in September.</p>

<p>We learn from Cormac that the fires were generally
double and that cattle were driven between them.</p>

<p>Concerning this question of fire, both Mr. Frazer and
the Rev. S. Baring-Gould<a href="#Footnote34" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor34">[34]</a>
suggest that we are justified<span class="pagenum" id="Page190">[190]</span>
in considering the Christian treatment of the sacred
fire as a survival of pagan times. Mr. Baring-Gould
writes as follows:&mdash;&#8220;When Christianity became dominant,
it was necessary to dissociate the ideas of the
people from the central fire as mixed up with the old
gods; at the same time the central fire was an
absolute need. Accordingly the Church was converted
into the sacred depository of the perpetual fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>He further points out that there still remain in some
of our churches (in Cornwall, York, and Dorset) the
contrivances&mdash;now called cresset-stones&mdash;used. They
are blocks of stone with cups hollowed out. Some are
placed in lamp-niches furnished with flues. On these
he remarks (p. <span class="nowrap">122):&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now although these lamps and cressets had their
religious signification, yet this religious signification
was an afterthought. The origin of them lay in the
necessity of there being in every place a central light,
from which light could at any time be borrowed; and
the reason why this central light was put in the church
was to dissociate it from the heathen ideas attached
formerly to it. As it was, the good people of the
Middle Ages were not quite satisfied with the central
church fire, and they had recourse in times of emergency
to other, and as the Church deemed them
unholy, fires. When a plague and murrain appeared
among cattle, then they lighted need-fires from two
pieces of dry wood, and drove the cattle between the
flames, believing that this new flame was wholesome
to the purging away of the disease. For kindling the
need-fires the employment of flint and steel was forbidden.
The fire was only efficacious when extracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page191">[191]</span>
in prehistoric fashion, out of wood. The lighting of
these need-fires was forbidden by the Church in the
eighth century. What shows that this need-fire was
distinctly heathen is that in the Church new fire was
obtained at Easter annually by striking flint and steel
together. It was supposed that the old fire in a
twelvemonth had got exhausted, or perhaps that all
light expired with Christ, and that new fire must be
obtained. Accordingly the priest solemnly struck new
fire out of flint and steel. But fire from flint and
steel was a novelty; and the people, Pagan at heart,
had no confidence in it, and in time of adversity went
back to the need-fire kindled in the time-honoured way
from wood by friction, before this new-fangled way of
drawing it out of stone and iron was invented.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same authority informs us that before Christianity
was introduced into Ireland by St. Patrick there was a
temple at Tara &#8220;where fire burned ever, and was on no
account suffered to go out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Frazer,<a href="#Footnote35" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor35">[35]</a> quoting Cerbied, shows that in the
ancient religion of Armenia the new fire was kindled
at the February festival of the May year, in honour of
the fire-god Mihr. &#8220;A bonfire was made in a public
place, and lamps kindled at it were kept burning
throughout the year in each of the fire-god&#8217;s temples.&#8221;
This festival now takes place at Candlemas, February 2.</p>

<p>We must assume, then, that the pagan fires were produced
by the friction of dry wood, and possibly in connection
with an ever-burning fire. In either case the
priests officiating at the various circles must have had
a place handy where the wood was kept dry or the<span class="pagenum" id="Page192">[192]</span>
fire kept burning, and on this ground alone we may
again inquire whether such structures as Maeshowe at
the Stenness circle, the Fougou at that of the Merry
Maidens, and indeed chambered barrows and cairns
generally, were not used for these purposes amongst
others; whether indeed they were not primarily built
for the living and not for the dead, and whether this
will explain the finding of traces of fires and of hollowed
stones in them, as well as some points in their structure.
Mr. MacRitchie<a href="#Footnote36" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor36">[36]</a> has brought together several of these
points, among them fireplaces and flues for carrying
away smoke.</p>

<p>At both solstices it would appear that a special fire-rite
was practised. This consisted of tying straw on a
wheel and rolling it when lighted down a hill. There
is much evidence for the wheel at the summer, but
less at the winter, solstice; still, we learn from the old
Runic <i>fasti</i> that a wheel was used to denote the
festival of Christmas. With regard to the summer
solstice I quote the following from Hazlitt (under
John, <span class="nowrap">St.):&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="figright w270" id="Fig48">

<img src="images/illo206.jpg" alt="" width="270" height="409" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 48</span>.&mdash;The Carro, Florence. From
Baring-Gould&#8217;s <i>Strange Survivals</i>.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>&#8220;Durandus, speaking of the rites of the Feast of
St. John Baptist, informs us of this curious circumstance,
that in some places they roll a wheel about to
signify that the sun, then occupying the highest place
in the Zodiac, is beginning to descend. &#8216;Rotam quoque
hoc die in quibusdam locis volvunt, ad significandum
quod Sol altissimum tunc locum in C&#339;lo occupet, et
descendere incipiat in Zodiaco.&#8217; Harl. MSS. 2345 (on
vellum), Art. 100, is an account of the rites of St. John
Baptist&#8217;s Eve, in which the wheel is also mentioned.<span class="pagenum" id="Page193">[193]</span>
In the amplified account of these ceremonies given by
Naogeorgus, we read that this wheel was taken up to
the top of a mountain and rolled down thence; and
that, as it had previously been covered with straw,
twisted about it and set on fire, it appeared at a
distance as if the sun had been falling from the sky.
And he further observes, that the people imagine that
all their ill-luck rolls away from them together with
this wheel. At Norwich, says a writer in <i>Current Notes</i>
for March, 1854, the rites of St. John the Baptist were
anciently observed, &#8216;when it was the custom to turn or
roll a wheel about, in signification of the sun&#8217;s annual
course, or the sun, then occupying the highest place in
the Zodiac, was about descending.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>At Magdalen College, Oxford, the May and June
years are clearly differentiated. There is a vocal service
at sunrise on May morning, followed by boys blowing
horns. At the summer solstice there is a sermon preached
during the day in the quadrangle.</p>

<p>One of the most picturesque survivals of this ancient
custom takes place at Florence each year at Easter.
This is fully described by Baring-Gould. The moment
the sacred fire is produced at the high altar a dove
(in plaster) carries it along a rope about 200 yards
long to a car in the square outside the west door of
the cathedral and sets fire to a fuse, thus causing the
explosion of fireworks.</p>

<p>The car with its explosives is the survival of the
ancient bonfire.</p>

<p>It would appear that the lighting of these fires on a
large scale lingered longest in Ireland and Brittany.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s Magazine</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page194">[194]</span>
(February, 1795) thus describes the Irish Beltane fires
in 1782, &#8220;the most singular sight in <span class="nowrap">Ireland&#8221;:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly at midnight, the fires began to appear,
and taking the advantage of going up to the leads of
the house, which had a widely extended view, I saw
on a radius of thirty miles, all around, the fires
burning on every eminence which the country afforded.
I had a farther satisfaction
in learning, from undoubted
authority, that
the people danced round
the fires, and at the close
went through these fires,
and made their sons and
daughters, together with
their cattle, pass through
the fire; and the whole
was conducted with religious
solemnity.&#8221;</p>

<p>It will have been observed
with reference to
these fire festivals that
although there were undoubtedly
four, in May,
August, November and
February, those in May and November were more
important than the others. This no doubt arose from
the fact that at different times the May and November
celebrations were <i>New Year</i> festivals. With regard to
the New Year in November in Celtic and later times.
Rhys writes as follows (<i>Hibbert Lectures</i>, p. <span class="nowrap">514):&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The Celts were in the habit formerly of counting<span class="pagenum" id="Page195">[195]</span>
winters, and of giving precedence in their reckoning
to night and winter over day and summer (p. 360); I
should argue that the last day of the year in the
Irish story of Diarmait&#8217;s death meant the eve of
November or All-halloween, the night before the Irish
<i>Samhain</i>, and known in Welsh as <i>Nos Galan-gaeaf</i>,
or the Night of the Winter Calends. But there is no
occasion to rest on this alone, as we have the evidence
of Cormac&#8217;s Glossary that the month before the
beginning of winter was the last month; so that the
first day of the first month of winter was also the
first day of the year.&#8221;</p>

<p class="blankbelow75">That the November bonfire was recognised as heralding
the dominion of the gods and spirits of darkness,<a href="#Footnote37" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor37">[37]</a>
that the old ideas surrounding Horus and Set in
Egypt were not forgotten, is evidenced by the fact
that when it was extinct the whole company round it
would suddenly take to their heels, shouting at the
top of their <span class="nowrap">voices:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">A piecing together of the folklore and traditions of
different districts suggests that sacrifices were made
in connection with the fire festivals, in fact that the
fire at one of the critical times of the May year at least
was a sacrificial one.</p>

<p>I will quote two cases given by Gomme<a href="#Footnote38" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor38">[38]</a> for May
Day and All Souls&#8217; Day <span class="nowrap">respectively:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;At the village of Holne, situated on one of the
spurs of Dartmoor, is a field of about two acres, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page196">[196]</span>
property of the parish, and called the Ploy Field. In
the centre of this field stands a granite pillar (Menhir)
six or seven feet high. On May-morning, before daybreak,
the young men of the village used to assemble
there, and then proceed to the moor, where they
selected a ram lamb, and after running it down,
brought it in triumph to the Ploy Field, fastened it
to the pillar, cut its throat and then roasted it whole,
skin, wool, &amp;c. At midday a struggle took place, at
the risk of cut hands, for a slice, it being supposed
to confer luck for the ensuing year on the fortunate
devourer. As an act of gallantry the young men
sometimes fought their way through the crowd to
get a slice for the chosen amongst the young women,
all of whom, in their best dresses, attended the Ram
Feast, as it was called. Dancing, wrestling, and other
games, assisted by copious libations of cider during the
afternoon, prolonged the festivity till midnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the parish of King&#8217;s Teignton, Devonshire, &#8220;a
lamb is drawn about the parish on Whitsun Monday
in a cart covered with garlands of lilac, laburnum and
other flowers, when persons are requested to give
something towards the animal and attendant expenses;
on Tuesday it is then killed and roasted whole in the
middle of the village. The lamb is then sold in slices
to the poor at a cheap rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>The popular legend concerning the origin of this
custom introduces two important elements&mdash;a reference
to &#8220;heathen days&#8221; and the title of &#8220;sacrifice&#8221; ascribed
to the killing of the lamb (p. 31).</p>

<p>&#8220;At St. Peter&#8217;s, Athlone, every family of a village
on St. Martin&#8217;s Day kills an animal of some kind or<span class="pagenum" id="Page197">[197]</span>
other; those who are rich kill a cow or sheep, others
a goose or turkey, while those who are poor kill a
hen or cock; with the blood of the animal they sprinkle
the threshold and also the four corners of the house,
and &#8216;this performance is done to exclude every kind
of evil spirit from the dwelling where the sacrifice is
made till the return of the same day the following
year&#8217;&#8221; (p. 163).</p>

<p>Other traditions indicate that human sacrifices were
in question, and that lots were drawn, or some other
method of the choice of a victim was adopted. I quote
from Hazlitt (i., 44) the following report of the Minister
of Callender in <span class="nowrap">1794:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The people of this district have two customs, which
are fast wearing out, not only here, but all over the
Highlands, and therefore ought to be taken notice of,
while they remain. Upon the first day of May, which
is called Beltan, or B&agrave;l-tein-day, all the boys in a
township or hamlet meet in the moors. They cut a
table in the green sod, of a round figure, by casting a
trench in the ground of such a circumference as to hold
the whole company. They kindle a fire, and dress a
repast of eggs and milk in the consistence of a custard.
They knead a cake of oatmeal, which is toasted at the
embers against a stone. After the custard is eaten
up, they divide the cake into so many portions, as
similar as possible to one another in size and shape,
as there are persons in the company. They daub one
of these portions all over with charcoal, until it be
perfectly black. They put all the bits of the cake
into a bonnet. Everyone, blindfold, draws out a
portion. He who holds the bonnet is entitled to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page198">[198]</span>
last bit. Whoever draws the black bit is the devoted
person, who is to be sacrificed to Baal, whose favour
they mean to implore in rendering the year productive
of the sustenance of man and beast. There is little
doubt of these inhuman sacrifices having been once
offered in this country as well as in the East, although
they now pass from the act of sacrificing, and only
compel the devoted person to leap three times through
the flames; with which the ceremonies of the festival
are closed.&#8221;</p>

<p>I may conclude this chapter by referring to similar
practices in Brittany, where Baring-Gould<a href="#Footnote39" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor39">[39]</a> has so
successfully studied them.</p>

<p>The present remnants of the old cult in the different
parishes are now called &#8220;pardons&#8221;;<a href="#Footnote40" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor40">[40]</a> they are still
numerous. I give those for the May and August festivals
(p. 83).</p>

<p>Judging by the &#8220;pardons,&#8221; the solstitial celebrations
are not so numerous as those connected with the May
year; the bonfire is built up by the head of a family
in which the right is hereditary. The fire has to be
lighted only by a pure virgin, and the sick and feeble
are carried to the spot, as the bonfire flames are held
to be gifted with miraculous healing powers.</p>

<p>When the flames are abated, stones are placed for
the souls of the dead to sit there through the remainder
of the night and enjoy the heat. &#8220;Every member of
the community carries away a handful of ashes as a
sovereign cure for sundry maladies. The whole proceeding
is instinct with paganism&#8221; (p. 75). With
regard to the accompanying sacrifices we read: &#8220;In
ancient times sacrifices were made of cocks and oxen
at certain shrines&mdash;now they are still presented, but it
is to the chapels of saints. S. Herbot receives cow&#8217;s
tails, and these may be seen heaped upon his altar
in Loqeffret. At Coadret as many as seven hundred
are offered on the day of the &#8220;pardon.&#8221; At S. Nicolas-des-Eaux,
it is S. Nicodemus who in his chapel receives
gifts of whole oxen, and much the same takes place at
Carnac.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XX</span><br />
<span class="h2name">SACRED TREES</span></h2>

<p>The subject of tree-worship is a vast one, as anyone
may gather who will read the <i>Golden Bough</i>. Fortunately
for my readers it is not necessary to discuss the whole
or even any great part of it in connection with the
inquiry which now concerns us. I may say that only
rarely is the old tree-worship considered with its concomitant
of temple-worship, so that I now have to
bring together information widely separated because the
connection which I have to show was intimate has not
been enlarged upon; indeed, in many cases it has not
been suspected.</p>

<p>There is another limitation of the inquiry. We have
only to deal chiefly with those plants and trees recorded
as worshipped at the chief festival times of the year,
which have already been marked out for us by the fire
ceremonials. These fires were like the chronofer installed
in modern days at the General Post Office, their practical
function being to give the time; they announced the beginning
of a new season.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page201">[201]</span></p>

<p>In <a href="#Page25">Chapter IV.</a> I referred to the association of
Mistletoe with the Solstitial worship. When we deal
with the May year we meet constantly with references
to the Rowan and the Hawthorn in the folklore connected
with it. We seem in presence, then, not only
of tree cult generally, but of sacred trees special to each
of the two worships we have been considering. I
propose now, therefore, to bring together some of the
information to be gathered from a very cursory reference
to the vast literature which exists on the subject.</p>

<p>In the first instance I begged my friend, Professor
Bayley Balfour, Keeper of the King&#8217;s Garden at Edinburgh,
to give me some particulars of the Rowan Tree,
which I imagined (1) to have been chosen on account of its
flowers being prominent about May Day (Beltane) and its
berries in early November (Hallowe&#8217;en), and (2) to have a
different habitat from the Mistletoe. I have to thank my
friend for much valuable information.</p>

<p>The Rowan Tree, called also the Mountain Ash (<i>Pyrus
Aucuparia</i>), seems to grow pretty freely all over the
<i>Northern</i> parts of Europe. Professor Balfour tells me:
&#8220;Rowan is essentially a Northern plant&mdash;an immigrant
to Europe from N.W. Asia&mdash;and now is spread all over
North and Central Europe in abundance, with only some
&#8216;feelers&#8217; passing south into the Mediterranean Basin.
It does not go south of Cappadocia in Asia Minor.
It does not reach Greece. In Italy it occurs on the
Eastern Apennines, and also in N.E. Sicily. In Spain
it runs over the higher regions in the N. and into the
centre, passing just into Portugal. Its occurrence in
Madeira is not certainly established as a natural phenomenon;
perhaps it is only introduced there. In all<span class="pagenum" id="Page202">[202]</span>
these Southern outruns the tree cannot be said to have
any dominance, and its area and abundance are infinitely
less than in the North. Scandinavia is one of its best
homes. Everywhere it is found right north to 71&deg;,
there becoming a bush only, but yet ripening seed. It
reaches Iceland, where trees of some size occur. All
over Great Britain and Ireland it is generally spread.
You may certainly say there is much in Norway, and
there is equally certainly less, even little, in Italy.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Pratt&#8217;s <i>Flowering Plants of Great Britain</i> (vol. 2,
p. 260) it is stated, &#8220;The flowers, which grow in dense
clusters, and are greenish-white, appear in May....
In autumn, however, the tree is more beautiful than in
summer, for at that season the rich cluster of red fruits
gleams among the foliage, each berry having the form of
a tiny apple, and containing a little core and seeds
within.&#8221;</p>

<p>At Christiania the mean of ten years&#8217; flowering is
given by Professor Sch&uuml;beler<a href="#Footnote41" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor41">[41]</a> as&mdash;first flowers, June 19;
general flowering, June 30. This, then, is later than
in Britain. On high grounds the fruit is conspicuous
here on November 1; on lower levels the birds attack
it and reduce its striking appearance before that date.</p>

<p>Associated with the Rowan in the folklore connected with
temple worship is the Hawthorn, Whitethorn or &#8220;May&#8221;
(<i>Crategus oxyocantha</i>), which also flowers at the beginning
of May, while its berries or &#8220;haws,&#8221; like those of the
Rowan, are conspicuous in November. We see, then, that
there is a most obvious reason in this for the association
of the two trees. According to Rhys,<a href="#Footnote42" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor42">[42]</a>
the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page203">[203]</span>
name appears to be of Scandinavian origin, the Old
Norse being <i>reynir</i>, Danish <i>r&ouml;nne</i>, Swedish <i>r&ouml;nn</i>; and
the old Norsemen treated the tree as holy and sacred
to Thor.</p>

<p>These two trees interest us from three points of
view. We find them connected <span class="nowrap">with:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">1. May and November celebrations.</p>

<p>2. Superstitions concerning witchcraft, &amp;c.</p>

<p>3. Holy wells.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">In this chapter I shall deal with the two former.</p>

<h3>I. <i>The May Celebrations.</i></h3>

<p>Seeing that the year beginning in May was established
because that month really opened the vegetation year,
it is little to be wondered at that among the chief
features of New Year&#8217;s Day was what we may term a
flower worship; it is probable that we are here dealing
with the sacred-tree side of the general festival
at all the monuments erected in connection with the
May year worship. The old traditions have lingered
longest around the things we have still with us, the
trees and flowers; and it is in connection with this
side of the worship that most information is available.
From the facts I have already stated, for Britain the
Rowan and Hawthorn were most naturally selected as
the typical forms.<a href="#Footnote43" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor43">[43]</a></p>

<p>Many poets have written of this festival<a href="#Footnote44" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor44">[44]</a>:
Chaucer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page204">[204]</span>
Shakspere, Milton, Bourne, Herrick and others. Chaucer
writes:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">

</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>There is a vast literature connected with May Day
celebrations, among it references to Celtic customs, and
I may add that, besides May Day, August, November and
February had their flower festivals also. I shall, however,
deal chiefly with May in this book to keep it within bounds.</p>

<p>May Day in Manx was termed <i>Shenn Laa Boaldyn</i>;
it is the <i>belltaine</i> of Cormac&#8217;s <i>Glossary</i>, the Scotch
Gaelic equivalent of which is <i>bealtuinn</i>.</p>

<p>The traditions and customs connected with May
Day in Great Britain have survived longest in the West
of England; even now, as will be seen by the account
of recent celebrations at Helston in Cornwall, given
below, they are still continued.</p>

<p>Altogether the customs, ancient and modern, of which
the flower worship formed a part, may be summed up as
<span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">1. Lighting of bonfires,<a href="#Footnote45" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor45">[45]</a>
and, in the evening, houses<span class="pagenum" id="Page205">[205]</span>
illuminated with candles, torches carried about, and
fireballs played with.</p>

<p>2. Man and beast passed through the fire or between
two fires.</p>

<p>3. Going out at daybreak to gather Whitethorn or
May (Sycamore in Cornwall), and making whistles of
the branches for the May-music and merry-making.
Blowing of tin horns at daybreak by boys, and from
money received getting breakfast at a farmhouse.</p>

<p>4. Flower-bedecked girls dance round a Maypole, and
one chosen as &#8220;Queen of the May.&#8221;</p>

<p>5. In Cornwall the custom prevailed till lately of
going out with buckets or any available vessels full of
water and thoroughly wetting anyone who was not
wearing a piece of May.</p>

<p>6. The &#8220;Furry Dance&#8221; (in Cornwall), which consists
in dancing through the town and also through as many
houses as desired. If resistance is offered it is permitted
to break open the door, and no penalty can be
imposed.</p>

<p>7. Sacrifices made (Isle of Man) at a very ancient
date, and probably human ones still earlier (Scotland).</p>

<p>8. Special worship at holy wells.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Flowers are public property on Flora Day, and this
custom of dancing through the <i>houses</i> is supposed to
have originated probably for the purpose of picking
the flowers in the gardens behind.</p>

<p>The following is a short abstract of a very interesting
account given in <i>The Western Weekly News</i>,
May 13th, 1905, of the &#8220;Flora Day&#8221; at Helston,
Cornwall, which took place this year. It gives us<span class="pagenum" id="Page206">[206]</span>
an idea of former festivals which are so quickly dying
<span class="nowrap">out:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The Furry Dance is always the feature of the day.
The first part took place at seven o&#8217;clock in the morning,
at which hour two couples started out and danced
through the streets and through some houses of residents.
The great dance was at noon, and those taking part
in it assembled in the Corn Exchange.</p>

<p>When all was ready the whole company, headed by a
band playing the old Furry Dance, started out and
danced through the town and through many houses.</p>

<p>The rest of the day was given over to a Horse Show
and to much merry-making. Excursions had been run
from all parts.</p>

<h3>II. <i>The Rowan Tree and Witchcraft.</i></h3>

<p>There is little doubt that in the constant association
of the Rowan with the May worship and the holy wells
which were adjacent to the stone circles where the worship
was conducted, we find the reason of the selection of
the wood of the Rowan Tree as an antidote to all the
ills which witchcraft was supposed to bring about.
Rhys tells us that &#8220;The tree has also the old names of
Quicken-tree, Roddon, and Witchen-tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>To quote again from Pratt (<i>op. cit.</i> vol. 2, p. 261):
&#8220;The old notion that the Mountain Ash, or Rowan Tree,
as it is called in the North, was efficacious against
witchcraft and the evil eye, still prevails in the North
of England and the Scottish Highlands. Pennant remarks,
in his <i>Tour of Scotland</i>, that the farmers carefully preserve
their cattle against witchcraft by placing branches<span class="pagenum" id="Page207">[207]</span>
of Honeysuckle and Mountain Ash in their cowhouses on
the 2nd of May. The milkmaid in Westmorland may
often be seen, even now, with a branch of this tree
either in her hand or tied to her milking-pail, from a
similar superstition; and in earlier days crosses cut out
of its wood were worn about the person. In an old
song called &#8220;Laidley Wood,&#8221; in the <i>Northumberland
Garland</i>, we find a reference to this:</p>

<div class="poemcenter">

<div class="poem">

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i00">&#8220;The spells were vain, the hag return&#8217;d<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Queen in sorrowful mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crying, that witches have no power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where there is Rown-tree wood.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div><!--stanza-->

</div><!--poem-->

</div><!--poemcenter-->

<p>Rhys, referring to May Day customs in the Isle of
Man, writes<a href="#Footnote46" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor46">[46]</a>: &#8220;This was a day when systematic efforts
were made to protect man and beast against elves and
witches; for it was then that people carried crosses of
rowan in their hats and placed may-flowers over the
tops of their doors and elsewhere as preservatives
against all malignant influences. With the same object
in view, crosses of rowan were likewise fastened to the
tails of the cattle, small crosses which had to be made
without the help of a knife.&#8221;</p>

<p>In connection with this last reference, Rhys quotes a
passage showing that a similar thing is done in Wales
on May Eve.<a href="#Footnote47" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor47">[47]</a> &#8220;Another bad papistic habit which
prevails among some Welsh people is that of placing
some of the wood of the rowan-tree (<i>coed cerdin</i> or
criafol) in their corn lands (<i>ttafyrieu</i>) and their fields
on May-eve (<i>Nos Glamau</i>) with the idea that such a
custom brings a blessing on their fields, a proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page208">[208]</span>
which would better become atheists and pagans than
Christians.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rhys also tells us that in Lincolnshire,<a href="#Footnote48" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor48">[48]</a> &#8220;a twig
of the rowan-tree, or wicken, as it is called, was effective
against all evil things, including witches. It is useful
in many ways to guard the welfare of the household,
and to preserve both the live stock and the crops;
while placed on the churn it prevents any malign
influence from retarding the coming of the butter.&#8221;</p>

<p>We also read (p. 358): &#8220;Not only the Celts, but
some also of the Teutons, have been in the habit of
attaching great importance to the rowan or roan tree,
and regarding it as a preservative against the malignant
influence of witches and all things uncanny....
Moreover, the Swede of modern times believes the
rowan a safeguard against witchcraft, and likes to have
on board his ship something or other made of its
wood, to protect him against tempests and the demons
of the water world.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Hibbert Lectures, 1886, we have another interesting
reference to this tree. Rhys first relates an old Irish
fairy story, the scene of which is supposed to have
been &#8220;on the plain near the Lake of Lein of the
Crooked Teeth, that is to say, the Lake of Killarney.&#8221;
In it we are told that the scarlet quicken-berries were
first brought from the &#8220;Land of Promise,&#8221; that one
was accidentally dropped and took root, and &#8220;from the
berry there grew up a tree which had the virtues of
the quicken-tree growing in fairy-land, for all the berries
on it had many virtues.&#8221; Then we learn (page 358)
that these berries &#8220;formed part of the sustenance of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page209">[209]</span>
gods, according to Goidelic notions; and the description
which has been quoted of the berries makes them a
sort of Celtic counterpart to the soma-plant of Hindu
mythology.&#8221;</p>

<p>This suggests that at the November Celebration a
decoction or brew of Rowan berries was used for
curative or superstitious purposes.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">I have thought it desirable to enter at some length
into the use of the Rowan as a protection against witchcraft
and as the basis of a brew used for different
purposes, because the Mistletoe has been dealt with in
exactly the same manner; indeed, it was to the later
Solstitial worship what the Rowan and Maythorn were
to the earlier May worship.</p>

<p>Mr. Frazer has collected in his <i>Golden Bough</i><a href="#Footnote49" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor49">[49]</a> much
information bearing on these points.</p>

<p>In Sweden, on Midsummer Eve, Mistletoe is sought
after, the people &#8220;believing it to be, in a high degree,
possessed of mystic qualities; and that if a sprig of
it be attached to the ceiling of the dwelling-house,
the horse&#8217;s stall, or the cow&#8217;s crib, the &#8216;Troll&#8217; will
then be powerless to injure either man or beast.&#8221; The
Oak Mistletoe, we are told, is &#8220;held in the highest
repute in Sweden, and is commonly seen in farmhouses
hanging from the ceiling to protect the dwelling from
all harm, but especially from fire; and persons afflicted
with the falling sickness think they can ward off
attacks of the malady by carrying about with them a
knife which has a handle of Oak Mistletoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page210">[210]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;A Swedish remedy for other complaints is to hang a
sprig of Mistletoe round the sufferer&#8217;s neck, or to make
him wear on his finger a ring made from the plant.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would appear from Mr. Frazer&#8217;s inquiries that the
Mistletoe was <i>en &eacute;vidence</i> at both the summer and
winter solstice&mdash;precisely as the Rowan and Hawthorn
were associated with the May and November festivals.</p>

<p>He <span class="nowrap">writes:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The sacred mistletoe may have acquired, in the
eyes of the Druids, a double portion of its mystic
qualities at the solstice in June, and accordingly they
may have regularly cut it with solemn ceremony on
Midsummer Eve. The conjecture is confirmed when
we find it to be still a rule of folklore that the
mistletoe should be cut on this day. Further, the
peasants of Piedmont and Lombardy still go out on
Midsummer-morning to search the oak-leaves for the
&#8216;oil of St. John,&#8217; which is supposed to heal all wounds
made with cutting instruments. Originally, perhaps, the
&#8216;oil of St. John&#8217; was simply the mistletoe, or a
decoction made from it. For in Holstein the mistletoe,
especially oak-mistletoe, is still regarded as a panacea
for green wounds; and if, as is alleged, &#8216;all-healer&#8217; is
the name of the plant in the modern Celtic speech of
Brittany, Wales, Ireland and Scotland, this can be
nothing but a survival of the name by which, as we
have seen, the Druids addressed the oak, or rather,
perhaps, the mistletoe. At Lacaune, in France, the old
Druidical belief in the mistletoe as an antidote to all
poisons still survives among the people; they apply
the plant to the stomach of the sufferer, or give him a
decoction of it to drink.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page211">[211]</span></p>

<p>If we attempt to collate the different festivals with
the vegetation most striking or abundant at each, in
different countries naturally possessing different floras, a
great variety of plants and trees has to be considered.
It is probable that the Rowan-tree was chiefly taken
here as the representative of the ash in more southern
and eastern lands, and the ash indeed did not always
take second rank, especially in the worship connected
with wells, as we shall see. Grimm<a href="#Footnote50" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor50">[50]</a> calls the ash &#8220;a
world tree which links heaven, earth and hell together;
of all trees the greatest and holiest.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the same way at the later established Vernal
Equinox festival, the palm which grows in lower latitudes
was replaced here by the willow. Coles, in his <i>Adam in
Eden</i>,<a href="#Footnote51" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor51">[51]</a> writes: &#8220;The willow blossoms come forth before
any leaves appear, and are in their most flourishing
state usually before Easter, divers gathering them to
deck up their houses on Palm Sunday, and therefore
the said flowers are called palme.&#8221; Willows are still
used to deck churches at this time.</p>

<p>As in the case of the Rowan, the willow (or palm)
was a protection against witchcraft; small crosses and
palm were carried about in the purses and placed upon
doors. These crosses had to be made on Palm Sunday
out of the wood used in the church. Sometimes box
replaced the willow.</p>

<p>We are driven to the conclusion that practices connected
with magic, the precursor of the later &#8220;witchcraft,&#8221;
were associated with the festivals now in question,<span class="pagenum" id="Page212">[212]</span>
and that the products of the vegetable world at the
different seasons were utilized for these purposes.</p>

<p>The putting on of a special garb by the vegetable
world at each season in turn would be one of the first
things to be manifested, and the close association of
it with the stars and the sun in their yearly course
would cause the representatives of it to be worshipped
together with them, and it would appear from the records
that the astronomer priests did not neglect those magical
arts which were practised by man in the early stages of
civilisation.</p>

<p>Indeed, these magical practices seem to have taken
such firm root that it was difficult to get rid of them
even in much later times. Newton<a href="#Footnote52" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor52">[52]</a> writes: &#8220;I once knew
a foolish cock-brained priest which ministered to a
certaine young man the ashes of boxe, being (forsooth)
hallowed on Palme Sunday, according to the superstitious
order and doctrine of the Romish Church, which ashes
he mingled with their unholie holie water using to the
same a kind of... exorcisme; which... medicine
(as he persuaded the standers by) had vertue to drive
away any ague.&#8221;</p>

<p>Among the virtues attributed to the May thorn was
that of preserving the beauty of those maidens who
at daybreak on May morning each year would wash
themselves in hawthorn dew. As late as 1515 it was
recorded that Catherine of Aragon, accompanied by
twenty-five of her ladies, sallied out on May morning
for this purpose.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXI</span><br />
<span class="h2name">HOLY WELLS AND STREAMS</span></h2>

<p>I have thought it most important to look up this
subject with a view of seeing whether any clues were
available which could help us to associate the introduction
of the well ceremonials with the worshippers of the
May or of the Solstitial year. For shortness I will
call the ceremonial &#8220;baptism,&#8221; not necessarily baptism
in the modern sense, but as implying the use of water for
purifying or other religious purpose.</p>

<p>That baptism was pre-Christian is shown by John
the Baptist using the Jordan for this purpose before
Christ&#8217;s ministration began. (Matt. 3. 6.)</p>

<p>There is a tremendous literature<a href="#Footnote53" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor53">[53]</a> dealing with the
folklore of holy wells and streams. The number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page214">[214]</span>
holy wells and streams in Britain is legion; there are
3,000 in Ireland alone, and the first thing which
strikes us in a casual study of the folklore is the close
association of the wells with sacred trees. Almost
equally distinctly we gather that both were situated
near holy stones, and that the worship included ceremonials
connected with all three.</p>

<p>The folklore dealing with holy wells and well-worship
is so various that it will be useful for our present
purpose to classify the portions we need under the
following headings.</p>

<p>1. Well-worship outcome of pre-Christian days and
customs.</p>

<p>2. Wells generally situated near circles, dolmens,
cromlechs or cairns, or churches which have replaced
them.</p>

<p>3. Association with sacred trees.</p>

<p>4. Well-worship and offerings.</p>

<p>5. Time of the chief festivals.</p>

<h3 class="inline">1. <i>Pagan origin.</i></h3>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;It seems to be accepted now that
well-worship in Britain originated long before the
Christian era; that it was not introduced by the
Christian missionaries, but rather they found it in vogue
on their arrival, and tolerated it at first and utilized
it afterwards, as they did a great many other Pagan
customs.</p>

<p>With regard to this point Wood-Martin writes:<a href="#Footnote54" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor54">[54]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;In many Irish MSS. there are allusions to this pre-Christian
worship. For example, Tirehan relates that<span class="pagenum" id="Page215">[215]</span>
St. Patrick, in his progress through Ireland, came to
a fountain called Slaun, to which the Druids offered
sacrifices, and which they worshipped as a God; and in
Adamnan&#8217;s <i>Life of St. Columkille</i> it is recounted that
this saint, when in the country of the Picts, heard of
a notable fountain to which the Pagans paid divine
honour.&#8221;</p>

<p>He adds (p. 50):</p>

<p>&#8220;It evidently did not originate in the blessing
of wells by early saints and thus spread downwards,
until it became almost, if not quite, universal;
on the contrary, it began from the people, who
were being Christianized, and thence permeated the
entire system of Irish Christianity.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baring-Gould tells us much concerning the transitional
state (pp. 28 <i>et seq.</i>). Wood-Martin divides
holy wells into three classes: (1) those which &#8220;derive
their reputed virtues from Pagan superstition&#8221;; (2)
those which were &#8220;transferred from Pagan to so-called
Christian uses,&#8221; and (3) &#8220;a few which may lay claim
to a merely Christian origin.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote55" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor55">[55]</a></p>

<p>It is very easy to understand how the purely devout
custom developed in course of time, in the case of
some wells at any rate, into a more superstitious one,
how some wells came to be called &#8220;wishing-wells&#8221; and
others were regarded as prophetic. Rhys gives us
several instances of these two classes in Wales.<a href="#Footnote56" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor56">[56]</a></p>

<p>Wishing-wells are known all over the United Kingdom;
many authors give accounts of them.<a href="#Footnote57" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor57">[57]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page216">[216]</span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that in the most ancient
times magical practices were carried on at wells or at
the religious centre of which the well formed a constituent
part. Local practices of witchcraft would be
a natural survival of these. Gomme (p. 87) thus refers
to the well of St. Aelian, not far from Bettws Abergeley,
in Denbighshire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Near the well resided a woman who officiated as a
kind of priestess. Anyone who wished to inflict a curse
upon an enemy resorted to this priestess, and for a
trifling sum she registered, in a book kept for the purpose,
the name of the person on whom the curse was
wished to fall. A pin was then dropped into the well
in the name of the victim, and the curse was complete.&#8221;</p>

<p>The magical associations with wells appear in the
following extract (given by Quiller-Couch, p. 134) of a
letter from Dr. O&#8217;Connor, the author of the letters of
Columbanus, to his brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have often inquired of your tenants what they
themselves thought of their pilgrimages to the wells of
<i>Kill-Aracht</i>, <i>Tobbar Brighde</i>, <i>Tobbar Muir</i>, near Elphin,
<i>Moor</i>, near <i>Castlereagh</i>, where multitudes annually
assembled to celebrate what they, in broken English,
termed <i>Patterns</i> (Patron&#8217;s days); and when I pressed
a very old man, Owen Hester, to state what possible
advantage he expected to derive from the singular
custom of frequenting in particular such wells as were
contiguous to an old blasted oak, <i>or an upright hewn
stone</i>, and what the meaning was of the yet more
singular custom of <i>sticking rags</i> on the branches of
such trees and spitting on them, his answer, and the
answer of the oldest men, was that their ancestors<span class="pagenum" id="Page217">[217]</span>
always did it, and that it was a preservation against
<i>Geasa Draoidecht</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the sorceries of the Druids, and
that their cattle were preserved by it from infectious
disorders; that the <i>daoini maithe</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, the fairies, were
kept in good humour by it; and so thoroughly persuaded
were they of the sanctity of these Pagan
practices that they would travel bareheaded and barefooted
from ten to twenty miles for the purpose of
crawling on their knees round these wells, upright
stones, and oak trees, westward, as the sun travels,
some three times, some six, some nine, and so on in
uneven numbers until their voluntary penances were
completely fulfilled.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="inline">2. <i>Wells generally situated near stone monuments or
churches which have replaced them.</i></h3>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;We find many
instances of wells near stone circles and dolmens.</p>

<p>It may even be that the existence of the spring
determined the position of the circle, for the officiating
astronomer-priest must like other mortals have had a
water supply available. &#8220;Where a spring or a river
flows,&#8221; says Seneca, &#8220;there should we build altars and
offer sacrifices&#8221; (Hope, p. 47). The following shows
how closely connected they were.<a href="#Footnote58" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor58">[58]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Closely associated with the circles, and occupying
an equally important position in the religious rites and
ceremonies of the ancient inhabitants, were sacred wells.
These were more numerous than circles, no doubt owing
to the fact that their acquisition was more easily accomplished:<span class="pagenum" id="Page218">[218]</span>
but amongst sacred wells we find some, as we
find certain circles, occupying a position of pre-eminence
in the religious cult of their votaries, and these, as a
rule, in close proximity to sun and moon temples. At
Tillie Beltane, in Aberdeenshire, in close proximity to
the remains of a larger and smaller circle, is a well
which was held sacred by the people. According to
Col. Leslie, on Beltane and Midsummer days, those on
whom the dire hand of disease had fallen, or those
desirous of averting that calamity, went seven times
round the sacred wells sunwise (deasil)<a href="#Footnote59" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor59">[59]</a> and then proceeded
to the circles, where a like ceremony was performed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In Stenness we find the same association of the well
and the circles. But in harmony with the unrivalled
completeness of these monuments... we find the
sacred well here in a closer and deeper connection with
the circles than elsewhere.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the parish of Stenness there is a district called
Bigswell, in the centre of which is a sacred well,
and from which the district takes its name, Big(s)well....
Be that as it may, we know from tradition that
down to the time when the Stone of Odin was demolished,
parents came to the well with children, on
Beltane and Midsummer, passed round it sunwise, and
having bathed their little ones (a healthy ordeal),
carried them thence to the Stone of Odin, and passed
them through the hole as a divine protection against
the malignant influences of the evil one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borlase records an instance of a well near a stone-circle<span class="pagenum" id="Page219">[219]</span>
in Ireland in the Townland of Ballyferriter, in
County Kerry.<a href="#Footnote60" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor60">[60]</a></p>

<p>The same author also gives examples in Ireland of
wells near dolmens, and of wells <i>covered</i> by dolmens.<a href="#Footnote61" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor61">[61]</a></p>

<p>It may be remarked that in Cornwall Chapel Euny
well is associated with the circles at Bartinn&eacute; and
Carn Euny; St. Cleer with the three circles at the
Hurlers, and Alsia well is near the Bolleit circle.
Mr. Horton Bolitho is my authority for these statements.</p>

<p>A well is often found near a cell, cairn or <i>keeill</i>.
Rhys gives us two examples in the Isle of Man.<a href="#Footnote62" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor62">[62]</a> At
Ardmore Bay the holy well is within the ruined chapel
of the saint.<a href="#Footnote63" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor63">[63]</a> A vast pile of stones surrounds the holy
well in Glencolumbkille in Donegal.<a href="#Footnote64" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor64">[64]</a></p>

<p>It might be useful to add here that it is a very
common thing to find a well by a so-called tomb
of a saint.</p>

<p>Let us turn now to wells situated near churches.</p>

<p>It is very generally known that many churches
have been built on the sites of stone-circles, menhirs,
&amp;c. This leads us to think that some form of
worship must have taken place at the &#8220;ancient-stones&#8221;
originally. The following extract from Wilson&#8217;s
<i>Arch&aelig;ology</i> (page 110) is given in <i>Stonehenge</i> by Sir
Henry James (page 17):</p>

<p>&#8220;The common Gaelic phrase&mdash;Am bheil thu dol don
chlachan&mdash;Are you going to the stones?&mdash;by which the
Scottish Highlander still enquires at a neighbour if he<span class="pagenum" id="Page220">[220]</span>
is bound for church, seems in itself no doubtful tradition
of ancient worship within the monolithic ring.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rhys<a href="#Footnote65" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor65">[65]</a> gives us many instances of wells near churches,
and here it may be useful to add that the Welsh for
well is Ffynnon.</p>

<p>Ffynnon Faglan is described as being near a church,
also Ffynnon Fair, a wishing-well. Criccieth Church
is supposed to have had a well near it at one time.
Again, Ffynnon Beris is near the parish church of
Llanberis (p. 366), and Ffynnon Elian near to the church
of Llanelian, Denbighshire. Then there are St. Teilo&#8217;s
Church and Well at Llandeilo Llwydarth, near Maen
Clochog, North Pembrokeshire.</p>

<p>Wood-Martin<a href="#Footnote66" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor66">[66]</a> refers to the rites at the well of
Tubberpatrick, part of the ceremony taking place in
the church near by.</p>

<h3 class="inline">3. <i>Association of sacred wells with sacred trees.</i></h3>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Rhys,
and many other authors, give us several
instances of a tree by the side of a well.<a href="#Footnote67" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor67">[67]</a></p>

<p>When we come to deal with well offerings we shall
find, in fact, that in almost every case a tree has been a
necessary companion of the well, as the well offerings
were hung on them.</p>

<p>In many cases, of course, the kind of tree is not
specified. When it is, it is almost invariably the rowan
or hawthorn. Rhys tells us: &#8220;The tree to expect by
a sacred well is doubtless some kind of thorn.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote68" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor68">[68]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page221">[221]</span></p>

<p>Then again, with reference to Ireland, Rhys, p. 335,
quotes a passage from a letter by the late Mr. W. C.
Borlase, on Rag Offerings and Primitive Pilgrimages in
Ireland, to the effect that a hawthorn almost invariably
stands by the brink of the typical Irish &#8220;holy well.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are also many references to thorn trees in the
same position in Wales.</p>

<p>There are thorn trees at St. Madron&#8217;s well in Cornwall,
and at Chapel well St. Breward in the same county near
Bodmin, there is a thorn tree over the well.</p>

<p>Not only are wells often recorded as near sacred trees,
but in the case of some we learn that at the chief
annual festival they were decked with flowers and
garlands, and &#8220;encircled with a jovial band of young
people celebrating the day with song and dance.&#8221; This
is recorded of the &#8220;blessing of the Brine&#8221; at Nantwich
(Hope, p. 7).</p>

<h3 class="inline">4. <i>Well worship and offerings.</i></h3>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;Although the traditions
and superstitions connected with wells are fast
becoming things of the past, in certain parts they are
still believed and practised.</p>

<p>Gomme<a href="#Footnote69" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor69">[69]</a> informs us that well-worship prevails in
every county of the three kingdoms. He finds it &#8220;most
vital in the Gaelic countries, somewhat less so in the
British, and almost entirely wanting in the Teutonic
south-east. In some cases wells were resorted to
for the cure of diseases; in others to obtain change of
weather or good luck. Offerings were made to them to
propitiate their guardian gods and nymphs. Pennant
tells us that in olden times the rich would sacrifice<span class="pagenum" id="Page222">[222]</span>
one of their horses at a well near Abergelen to secure
a blessing upon the rest.<a href="#Footnote70" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor70">[70]</a> Fowls were offered at St.
Tegla&#8217;s Well, near Wrexham, by epileptic patients,<a href="#Footnote71" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor71">[71]</a>
but of late years the well spirits have had to be
content with much smaller tributes&mdash;such trifles as
pins, rags, coloured pebbles and small coins.&#8221;</p>

<p>In consequence of this dwindling down of the offering
we have chiefly to do with rags, but I think we may learn
from the traditions that originally it was an offering of a
garment, and to the officiating priest, at the well, or temple
with which the well was connected. It is also a question
whether the almost universal association of pins with the
garment or part of it might not have originated at a time
when such an offering&mdash;it was probably originally a skin&mdash;to
a priest without a pin (of bone) to fasten it on would
not have been complete. In Kent&#8217;s cavern pins of bone
have been found associated with bones of pal&aelig;olithic
mammals.</p>

<p>Mr. Gomme tells us,<a href="#Footnote72" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor72">[72]</a> &#8220;In the case of some wells,
especially in Scotland, at one time the whole garment
was put down as an offering. Gradually these offerings
of clothes became less and less till they came down to
rags.&#8221; He also points out, as we have already seen,
that &#8220;the geographical distribution of rag-offerings
coincides with the existence of monoliths and dolmens.&#8221;</p>

<p>As has been noted, almost invariably by the side of
every well there grows the &#8220;sacred tree,&#8221; a rowan or
thorn for the most part; on this tree the rags are hung,
then the bent pin is dropped in. If there happens to
be no tree, or if it is so old that only the stump is<span class="pagenum" id="Page223">[223]</span>
left, then the rags may sometimes be seen wedged in
between the stones of the well.</p>

<p>Quiller-Couch (p. 135) tells us that at Ahagour in
Mayo is a well much frequented by pilgrims, for penance
chiefly, where among other offerings they cut up their
clothes, be they ever so new, and tie them to the two old
trees growing near, &#8220;lest, on the day of judgment,&#8221; thinks
the superstitious peasant, &#8220;the Almighty should forget
that he came there, and in order that the tokens should
be known, when St. Patrick should lay them before the
tribunal.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the original well-worship in relation with the
temples became disestablished, if the well-worship were
kept up at all, reasons other than the old one would soon
be invented, and many of these would naturally be connected
with magic and sorcery. In the oldest days the
priest would be a physician as well as an astronomer and
a magician, and his advice might be good for various disorders,
but after he had disappeared there was only magic
to depend upon; and this atmosphere is reflected in the
traditions.</p>

<p>I will now give a few extracts to show what goes on at
present in certain localities with regard to the offerings,
and the frame of mind of the devotees.</p>

<p>With reference to the reasons for the offerings made
in the present day, Wood-Martin writes:<a href="#Footnote73" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor73">[73]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Wells were the haunts of spirits that proved to be
propitious if remembered, but were vindictive if neglected,
and hence no devotee approached the sacred precincts
empty-handed, the principle being no gift no cure;
therefore the modern devotee, when tying up a fragment<span class="pagenum" id="Page224">[224]</span>
from the clothing, or dropping a cake, a small coin, or
a crooked pin into the well, is unconsciously worshipping
the old presiding spirit of the place.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rhys<a href="#Footnote74" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor74">[74]</a> gives us a great deal of information on this.
The ritual varies at some of them. People came from
far and near; it is the custom to make some sort of offering,
rags and pins being the most modern, and about
these we have most information as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Rhys quotes statements he has received about three
wells in the county of Glamorgan (Vol. 1, p. 356). At
the first it was the custom &#8220;that the person who wishes
his health to be benefited should wash in the water of
the well, and throw a pin into it afterwards.&#8221; At
another &#8220;the custom prevails of tying rags to the
branches of a tree growing close at hand&#8221;; and at the
third, &#8220;it is the custom for those who are healed in it
to tie a shred of linen or cotton to the branches of a tree
that stands close by; and there the shreds are almost
as numerous as the leaves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Further (p. 363) we read of another Ffynnon Faglan,
and of this Rhys says, &#8220;One told me his mother used
to take him to it when he was a child for sore eyes,
bathe them with the water, and then drop in a pin. The
other man, when he was young, bathed in it for rheumatism.&#8221;
Of this well it is recorded that when it was
cleaned out about fifty years ago &#8220;two basinfuls of pins
were taken out,&#8221; which were all bent, but no coins
were found in it.</p>

<p>Wood-Martin<a href="#Footnote75" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor75">[75]</a> also gives an interesting account of
the rite performed at a certain well in Ireland; it is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page225">[225]</span>
little more elaborate than at some, but affords an idea
of what was probably at one time a very usual
ceremony in connection with stones in other places.</p>

<p>&#8220;In a statistical account of the parish of Dungiven,
written in 1813, it is stated that at the well of
Tubberpatrick, after performing the usual rounds,
devotees wash their hands and feet with the water
and tear off a small rag from their clothes, which they tie
on a bush overhanging the well; from whence they all
proceed to a large stone in the River Roe, immediately
below the old church, and having performed an oblation
they walk round the stone, bowing to it, and repeating
prayers as at the well. Their next movement is to the
old church, within which a similar ceremony goes on, and
they finish this rite by a procession and prayers round
the upright stone.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="inline">5. <i>Time of the chief festival.</i></h3>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;On this point there is
not a great quantity of precise information, but what
we have points to May 1 as being about the time
when the holy wells are most frequented and considered
most efficacious.</p>

<p>This lack of information arises from the fact that the
existence of the May year in prehistoric times has not
been even dreamt of by those who have compiled the
various accounts of the fast fading traditions, and in very
many instances a reference to an unknown saint&#8217;s day is
the only information given as to the time of the annual
celebration. Wide generalisation, therefore, from the
material at hand is risky.</p>

<p>I will refer in the first instance to the May worship,
and begin with the famous Madron well in Cornwall, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page226">[226]</span>
walls of which I found to be oriented to the May sunrise,
so that the priest officiating at the altar would face the
sunrise. Quiller-Couch (p. 137) thus refers to what
happened there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Children used to be taken to this well on the first
three Sunday mornings in May to be dipped in the water,
that they might be cured of the rickets, or any other
disorder with which they were troubled. Three times
they were plunged into the water, after having been
stripped naked; the parent, or person dipping them,
standing facing the sun; after the dipping they were
passed nine times round the well from east to west; then
they were dressed and laid on St. Madern&#8217;s bed; should
they sleep, and the water in the well bubble, it was
considered a good omen. Strict silence had to be kept
during the entire performance, or the spell was broken.
At the present time the people go to the well in crowds
on the first Sunday in May, when the Wesleyans hold a
service there, and a sermon is preached; after which the
people throw in two pins or pebbles to consult the spirit,
or try for sweethearts; if the two articles sink together,
they will soon be married.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here divination is performed on May morning by
rustic maidens anxious to know when they are to be
married. Two pieces of straw about an inch long are
crossed and transfixed with a pin. This, floated on the
waters, elicits bubbles, the number of which, carefully
counted, denotes the years before the happy day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chapel Euny in Cornwall, near the Bartinn&eacute; circle, has
a wishing (lucky) well near it. It was used on one of
the three first Wednesdays in May. Children suffering
from mesenteric disease are dipped three times<span class="pagenum" id="Page227">[227]</span>
&#8220;widderschynnes,&#8221; that is contrary to the sun&#8217;s motion,
and dragged round the well three times in the same
direction.<a href="#Footnote76" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor76">[76]</a></p>

<p>Edmunds<a href="#Footnote77" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor77">[77]</a> thus refers to this <span class="nowrap">well:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Some years since I had the curiosity to go with a
friend to Chapel Euny on one of these Wednesdays, and,
whilst watching at a distance, we saw two women come to
the well at the appointed hour, and perform this ceremony
on an infant.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Alsia Well</i>, in the parish of Buryan, same parish as
Bolleit circle, has its well ceremonials on the first three
Wednesdays in May.</p>

<p>In Cornwall the May bathing ceremonial is even carried
out in salt water.<a href="#Footnote78" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor78">[78]</a> The time chosen is the same as that at
Madron and Chapel Euny, the first three Sundays in May.</p>

<p>This Sunday in May celebration is not confined to
Cornwall. At Eden Hall, Giant&#8217;s Cave, water with
sugar is drunk on the third Sunday in May. A vast
concourse of both sexes is present.<a href="#Footnote79" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor79">[79]</a></p>

<p>At Rorrington, a township in the parish of Chirbury,
was a holy well at which a wake was celebrated on
Ascension Day.</p>

<p>In the account of this well given by Gomme (p. 82)
we get a glimpse of many associated usages.</p>

<p>&#8220;The well was adorned with a bower of green boughs,
rushes, and flowers, and a may-pole was set up. The
people walked round the well, dancing and frolicking as
they went. They threw pins into the well to bring good
luck and to preserve them from being bewitched, and
they also drank some of the water. Cakes were also<span class="pagenum" id="Page228">[228]</span>
eaten; they were round flat buns from three to four
inches across, sweetened, spiced, and marked with a
cross, and they were supposed to bring good luck if
kept.&#8221;</p>

<p>The legend given by Quiller-Couch (p. 55) respecting
St. Cuthbert&#8217;s well in North Cornwall is that &#8220;in olden
times mothers on Ascension Day brought their deformed
or sickly children here, and dipped them in, at the same
time passing them through the aperture connecting the
two cisterns; and thus, it is said, they became healed of
their disease or deformity. It would seem that other classes
also believed virtue to reside in its water; for it is said
that the cripples were accustomed to leave their crutches
in the hole at the head of the well.&#8221;</p>

<p>At the village of Tissington, near Ashbourne, in Derbyshire,
the custom of well-flowering is still observed on
every anniversary of the Ascension (Hope, p. 48).</p>

<p>We may gather from these associated observances
at different places that the wells themselves were
situated near circles, for the worshippers would not
be distributed at such a time. This argument is
strengthened by the custom of &#8220;waking the well&#8221;
which took place on the patron saint&#8217;s day.</p>

<p>With regard to the time of the day or night at which
well-worship took place, there seems little doubt that for
the most part it was carried on at night. The practices
connected with the &#8220;waking of the well&#8221; indicate this
clearly, and when it is remembered that these ancient
worships were carried on at a time when marriage had
not been instituted, we can understand that many
&#8216;pagan&#8217; rituals savoured of sensualism as we should
now think and call it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page229">[229]</span></p>

<p>The particular times when it was considered most
propitious for the <i>sick</i> to visit the wells appear anciently
to have been at daybreak or sunrise.</p>

<p>At the well at Farr, in Sutherlandshire, it is held that
the patient, after undergoing his plunge, drinking of the
water, and making his offering, &#8220;must be away from the
banks so as to be fairly out of sight of the water before
the sun rises, else no cure is effected.&#8221; At Roche Holywell,
in Cornwall, before sunrise on holy Thursday was
the appointed time.</p>

<p>Sometimes the moment of sunrise is chosen. To bathe
in the well of St. Medan, at Kirkmaiden in Wigtonshire,
as the sun rose on the first Sunday in May was considered
an infallible cure for almost any disease.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in some cases, as at St. Madron&#8217;s
well, noon is chosen on the first three Sundays in May,
&#8220;not believing that these waters have any virtue if
resorted to on any other days of the year, or at any other
hour of the day.&#8221;</p>

<p>With regard to the August festival, there is a holy well
at St. Cleer, near the Hurlers; the festival is held on
August 9th.<a href="#Footnote80" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor80">[80]</a> I have no special references to August wells
in Ireland, but there is evidence given by Piers<a href="#Footnote81" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor81">[81]</a> that at
that time cattle were bathed.</p>

<p>&#8220;On the first Sunday in harvest, viz., in August, they
will be sure to drive their cattle into some pool or river
and therein swim them; this they observe as inviolable as
if it were a point of religion, for they think no beast will
live the whole year thro&#8217; unless they be thus drenched.<span class="pagenum" id="Page230">[230]</span>
I deny not but that swimming cattle, and chiefly in this
season of the year, is healthful unto them, as the poet
hath <span class="nowrap">observed:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">but precisely to do this on the first Sunday in harvest, I

<p>I next come to the solstice in June.</p>

<p>There is evidence concerning wells quite akin to that
furnished by the astronomical use of the circles, that the May
year festivals were subsequently changed to solstitial
dates. The well worship does not appear to have been
carried on in the cold weather&mdash;hence the absence of
references to February and November; for the same reason
we have only now to do with the summer solstice.</p>

<p>At Barnwell (Beirna-well = youths&#8217; well), near Cambridge,
the festival took place on St. John&#8217;s Day.<a href="#Footnote82" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor82">[82]</a></p>

<p>Brand, in his history of Newcastle (ii. 54), refers to a
well still called Bede&#8217;s Well, near Jarrow. &#8220;As late as
1740 it was a prevailing custom to bring children
troubled with any disease or infirmity; a crooked pin was
put in, and the well laved dry between each dipping.<span class="pagenum" id="Page231">[231]</span>
My informant has seen twenty children brought together
on a Sunday, to be dipped in this well, at which also, on
Midsummer Eve, there was a great resort of neighbouring
people, with bonfires, music, etc.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hope gives references to seven wells dedicated to
&#8220;St. John,&#8221; one to &#8220;St. John the Baptist,&#8221; and four to
St. Peter. These <i>may</i> have been solstitial wells, but the
information given is very slight and not to the present
point. He states (xxii) that the most important celebrations
were first held in May and at the summer solstice.
He then adds, &#8220;later Easter and Ascensiontide were the
favoured seasons.&#8221; May, Summer Solstice and Easter was,
I think, the true order.</p>

<p>Finally, I may refer to the earliest holy well known
to history. This is the famous well at Heliopolis where
R&#257; used to wash himself, and Piankhi, <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> 740, went and
washed his face in it. At this same well the Virgin sat
and washed her Son&#8217;s swaddling bands in it. Its water
made the balsam trees to grow. It is now called by
the Arabs &#8220;The Fountain of the Sun&#8221; &#8216;&Ecirc;yn ash-Shems.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">WHERE DID THE BRITISH WORSHIP ORIGINATE?</span></h2>

<p>The recent chapters have, I think, established, by the
evidence derived from folklore and tradition, that there
was in the long past a combined worship of trees,
wells and streams in the neighbourhood of sacred
places, the sacred place being a stone circle or some
other monument built up of stones.</p>

<p>We have gathered also that the chief times of
worship were on or near the most important dates
defined for us by the May year, the original year
marked out by the various agricultural and other
operations proper to the various seasons.</p>

<p>It is again imperative that I should point out that
if the basis of this worship was not utility it must
have been started by men sufficiently skilled to
indicate by their astronomical knowledge the proper
times for the various operations to which I have
referred. In this we see the reason for the local
combination of the worship in the neighbourhood of
the stones, for the stones were really the instruments
which enabled the astronomer-priest to be useful to<span class="pagenum" id="Page233">[233]</span>
the community; that he in process of time became
powerful and sacred because he was wise, and added
medicine and magic to his other qualifications, was
only what was to be expected.</p>

<p>I am not the first to have been driven by the
facts to note the close association to which I have
referred, that the cults were not separate but were
parts of one whole.</p>

<p>Wood-Martin speaks with the most certain sound
on this point. &#8220;It will be seen that, from a review
of the whole subject, stone, water, tree, and animal-worship
are intimately connected.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote83" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor83">[83]</a></p>

<p>What the analysis in the recent chapters, taken in
connection with the astronomical results previously
stated, has done is perhaps to give a clear reason for the
connection. Not only were the cults started together, but
they remained together for a long time; it is only in
quite late years that the traditions have become so
dim that practices once closely connected are now
dealt with apart from the rest.</p>

<p>Hope points out (p. xxii) that the 16th of the canons
of the reign of Edgar, <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 963, which enjoins the clergy
to be diligent, advance Christianity, and extinguish
heathenism, mentions especially the worship of stones,
trees, and fountains. The laws of Knut (<span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 1018)
specify the worship &#8220;of heathen gods, the sun, moon,
fire, rivers, fountains, rocks, or trees.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now, although the folklore evidence I have brought
together has been gathered for the most part from
the British Isles, my inquiries have not been limited
to that area.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page234">[234]</span></p>

<p>It was natural that when the study of folklore had
suggested that there was a close connection between
the worship carried on in Britain at stone monuments,
sacred trees, and sacred wells an attempt should
have been made to see whether these three cults had
been associated out of Britain with the ceremonials
of any of the early peoples for which complete and
trustworthy information is available.</p>

<p>On this point the traditions of widely sundered
countries is amazingly strong.</p>

<p>The folklore of the Pyrenees, France, Spain and
Portugal regarding sacred wells is very similar to that
of Ireland. Borlase writes:<a href="#Footnote84" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor84">[84]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;It is interesting to notice that the pre-Christian
custom called <i>dessil</i>, or circuit around a venerated spot,
which is practised in Ireland in the case of one dolmen
at least, as well as at wells and Churches innumerable,
is found also in Portugal.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the Pyrenees, too, fairies and spirits are thought
much of in this connection. Borlase tells us:<a href="#Footnote85" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor85">[85]</a> &#8220;They
are the presiding genii of certain wells.&#8221; He adds:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not in Ireland alone that dolmens are associated
with the notion of wells and water springs. The
Portuguese names, Anta do Fontao, Fonte Coberta, Anta
do Fonte-de Mouratao, and the French names, Fonte
de Rourre, and Fonte nay le Marmion, show this to be
the case.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote86" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor86">[86]</a></p>

<p>In Persia Sir Wm. Ouseley saw a tree covered with
rags, and similar trees in the Himalayas are associated
with large heaps of stones (Gomme, p. 105).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page235">[235]</span></p>

<p>The late General Pitt-Rivers affirms that the customs
of well-offerings I referred to in the last chapter are
invariably associated with cairns, megalithic monuments
or some such early Pagan institutions, and he adds that
the area in which traces of well-offerings are found is
conterminous with the area of the megalithic monuments.<a href="#Footnote87" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor87">[87]</a></p>

<p>The idea that the waters of certain wells have
marvellous healing powers is also not confined to the
British Isles, for in a great many parts of Europe,
perhaps more especially in France, Spain and Portugal,
we find instances.</p>

<p>The practice of worshipping in connection with wells
and the sacred stones and sacred trees which were associated
with them, as we have seen, was indeed in ancient
days almost, if not quite, universal wherever man existed.
The traditions of the past, therefore, are to be gathered
over a very wide area. I quote a summary of the
universality of this practice given by the late General
Pitt-Rivers in the paper already noticed:</p>

<p>&#8220;Burton says it extends throughout northern Africa
from west to east; Mungo Park mentions it in western
Africa; Sir Samuel Baker speaks of it on the confines of
Abyssinia, and says that the people who practised it
were unable to assign a reason for doing so; Burton also
found the same custom in Arabia during his pilgrimage to
Mecca; in Persia Sir William Ouseley saw a tree <i>close to
a large monolith</i> covered with these rags, and he describes
it as a practice appertaining to a religion long since proscribed
in that country; in the Dekkan and Ceylon
Colonel Leslie says that the trees in the neighbourhood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page236">[236]</span>
wells may be seen covered with similar scraps of cotton:
Dr. A. Campbell speaks of it as being practised by the
Limboos near Darjeeling in the Himalaya, where it is
associated, as in Ireland, with large heaps of stones; and
Huc in his travels mentions it among the Tartars.&#8221;</p>

<p>The astronomical facts given in this book, gathered
from a study of the monuments in these islands, can
only give us information touching the introduction of
the combined worship here.</p>

<p>My investigations have strongly suggested, to say the
least, that there were men here with knowledge enough to
utilise the movements of the sun and stars for temple,
and no doubt practical purposes before 2000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, that
is, a thousand years before Solomon was born, and at
about the time that the Hecatompedon was founded
at Athens.</p>

<p>If this is anywhere near the truth, these men must
have been representatives of a very old civilisation.</p>

<p>Now the civilisation principally considered by arch&aelig;ologists
in connection with the building of the monuments
which I have studied is the Aryan, of which the
Celts formed a branch. This view, however, is not
universally held; the late General Pitt-Rivers, and I
know of no higher authority, stated his opinion that
&#8220;The megalithic monuments... take us back to pre-Aryan
people, and suggest the spread of this people
over the area covered by their remains.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote88" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor88">[88]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Gomme is of the same opinion (p. 27):</p>

<p>&#8220;Ceremonies which are demonstrably non-Aryan in
India, even in the presence of Aryan people, must
in origin have been non-Aryan in Europe, though the<span class="pagenum" id="Page237">[237]</span>
race from whom they have descended is not at present
identified by ethnologists.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sergi also points <span class="nowrap">out:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Indo-Germanism led to almost entire forgetfulness
of the most ancient civilisations of the earth, those born
in the valleys of the Euphrates and the Tigris, and in
the valley of the Nile; no influence was granted to
them over Greco-Roman classic civilisation, almost none
anywhere in the Mediterranean.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote89" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor89">[89]</a></p>

<p>It is not necessary for me to deal at length with the
great Aryan controversy in this book, even if the subject
were within my competence, which it is not; but
now that we have a large number of monuments dated,
say, within twenty years of their use, it is important
to bring forward some dates arrived at by arch&aelig;ologists
and philologists to compare with those which the
astronomical method of inquiry has revealed.</p>

<p>Hall<a href="#Footnote90" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor90">[90]</a> gives evidence to show that the Aryans did
not reach Greece till after the earlier period of the
Mycen&aelig;an age, which he dates at about 1700 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>With regard to the date of the Aryan invasion of
Britain, Mr. Read, of the Department of Ethnography,
British Museum, informs me that it may be taken as
about 1000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>; it was associated with cremation. It
is highly probable that these Aryans were the Goidels
or the Gael. These were followed some 700 years later
by another Aryan sept&mdash;the Brythons. Mr. Read is
also of opinion that the Goidels reached Britain from
the country round the South Baltic, and the Brythons
from or through north-east France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page238">[238]</span></p>

<p>Arch&aelig;ologists, however, recognise a pre-Aryan invasion,
about 1800 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> (a date determined by the introduction
of bronze), of a brachycephalic folk who built covered
barrows, different in these respects from the neolithic
folk, who were long-skulled and built long barrows.
Now, in relation to the stone structures to which this
book especially refers, the question arises, are we then
dealing with this swarm or the people whom they
found on the soil?</p>

<p>There are some indications in the traditions which
imply that we are really dealing with an early stone
age, when flints were the only weapons, and there were
no clothes to speak of. I will give one or two examples
of these traditions. Gomme (p. 53) refers to a singular
fact preserved among the ceremonies of witchcraft in
Scotland:</p>

<p>&#8220;In order to injure the waxen image of the
intended victim, the implements used in some cases
by the witches were stone arrowheads, or elf-shots, as
they were called, and their use was accompanied by
an incantation. Here we have, in the undoubted form
of a prehistoric implement, the oldest untouched detail
of early life which has been preserved by witchcraft.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gomme (p. 39) also tells us that one of the May
practices at Stirling is for boys of ten and twelve years
old to divest themselves of their clothing, and in a state
of nudity to run round certain natural or artificial
circles. &#8220;Formerly the rounded summit of Demyat,
an eminence in the Ochil range, was a favourite scene
of this strange pastime, but for many years it has
been performed at the King&#8217;s Knot, in Stirling, an
octagonal mound in the Royal Gardens. The performances<span class="pagenum" id="Page239">[239]</span>
are not infrequently repeated at Midsummer
and Lammas.&#8221; He adds, &#8220;The fact that in this instance
the practice is continued only by &#8216;boys of ten and
twelve years old,&#8217; shows that we have here one of the
last stages of an old rite before its final abolition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baring-Gould (p. 21) provides us with a practice in
Brittany which would seem to be a remnant of a pre-clothing
age.</p>

<p>Near Carnac is a menhir, at which a singular &#8220;ceremony
took place till comparatively recently, and may perhaps
still be practised in secret. A married couple that have
no family repair to this stone when the moon is full,
strip themselves stark naked and course one another
round it a prescribed number of times, whilst their
relations keep guard against intrusion at a respectful
distance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now it is in connection with this question that I
am in hopes that some help may be got from the
astronomical results recorded in the present volume. The
dates revealed by the orientation of the circles and
outstanding stones already dealt with (and there is
a large number to follow) indicate that it is among
the records of some people of whom the civilisation
is very ancient that we must look in the first instance
with a view of tracing the origin of our British
monuments.</p>

<p>Further, now that we have been able to follow their
astronomical methods, to note how sound they were,
and to gather the purposes of utility they were intended
to serve, it is simply common sense to inquire, in the
first instance, if they may have been connected with
these ancient peoples whose astronomical skill is<span class="pagenum" id="Page240">[240]</span>
universally recognised, and whose records and even
observations have come down to us.</p>

<p>Now, while we know nothing of the astronomy of
the Aryans generally, or that of the Celts in particular,
the astronomical knowledge of the Babylonians
and Egyptians is one of the wonders of the ancient
world.</p>

<p>Hence Babylonia and Egypt are at once suggested,
and the suggestion is not rendered a less probable
one when we remember that both these peoples
studied and utilised astronomy at least some 8,000
years ago.</p>

<p>But here we are dealing with two peoples. It is
more than probable that they both were associated more
or less near the origin with one race, the ideas of which
permeated both civilisations.</p>

<p>I have it on the highest authority, that of Dr. Budge,
that in Babylonia there were originally the Sumerians
and the Semites. The primitive race which conquered
the Egyptians seems to have been connected with the
former as regards civilisation, and with the latter as
regards some aspects of the Egyptian language.</p>

<p>This race was Semitic, and as the pyramids, built
some 6,000 years ago, are a proof of the interaction of the
two civilisations at that time, for the Easter festival
celebrated on the banks of the Nile came from the
valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates, we may omit the
pre-Semites from our consideration.</p>

<p>There is other evidence that the connection between
the Semites and Egyptians was close astronomically,
so that any Semitic influence in later times or in
other lands would be sure to show traces of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page241">[241]</span>
connection, and in temple worship it would be traceable.
While the carefully oriented Egyptian temples built
of stone remain and have been carefully studied,
those erected in the centres of Semitic power, built of
unbaked brick, have for the most part disappeared, but
for the most part only; some stone structures remain,
but in regard to them there has been no Lepsius; of
their orientation, too, little is known. This is all the
more to be regretted since Layard, in addition to many
E. and N. buildings found at Nimrood, noted at the
mound of Kouyunjik, the site of Nineveh, lat. 36&deg; 20&#8242; N.,
that Sennacherib&#8217;s palace, which appears to have been
built round a central temple, was oriented to the May
year.<a href="#Footnote91" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor91">[91]</a> (Az. N. 68&deg; 30&#8242; E. = Dec. N. 16&deg;.)</p>

<p>Now, calling in the Babylonians as the originators of
what went on in Britain 4,000 years ago may seem
to some to be far-fetched in more ways than one;
but the Babylonians were a remarkable people; according
to some they originated all the voyaging of the early
world, though other authorities point out that the first
ships in the eastern seas must have been Indian.</p>

<p>Ihering<a href="#Footnote92" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor92">[92]</a> adduces a series of facts which indicate
clearly that the Babylonians carried on maritime
navigation at least as early as about 3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> But,
whatever this time was, the Semites and Egyptians had
already a rich culture behind them at a time when the
Aryans, whatever or wherever their origin, had not made
themselves a place in the world&#8217;s history. An ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page242">[242]</span>
sea connection between Babylonia and India may
explain the similarity of the British and Indian
folklore.</p>

<p>Some facts with regard to long distance ancient
travel are the following. Our start-point may be that
Gudea, a Babylonian king who reigned about 2500
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, brought stones from Melukhkha and Makan, that
is, Egypt and Sinai (Budge, <i>History of Egypt</i>, ii.,
130). Now these stones were taken coastwise
Sinai to Eridu, at the head of the Persian Gulf,
a distance of 4,000 miles, and it is also said that
then, or even before then, there was a coast-wise
traffic to and from Malabar, where teak was got to
be used in house- and boat-building. The distance
from Eridu coastwise to Malabar, say the present
Cannanore, is 2,400 miles.</p>

<p>The distance, coastwise, from Alexandria to Sandwich,
where we learn that Ph&#339;nicians and others
shipped the tin extracted from the mines in Cornwall,
is only 5,300 miles, so that a voyage of this length
was quite within the powers of the compassless navigators
of 2500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The old idea that the ancient merchants could
make a course from Ushant to, say, Falmouth or
Penzance need no longer be entertained; the crossing
from Africa to Gibraltar and from Cape Grisnez
to Sandwich were both to visible land, <i>i.e.</i> coastwise.
The cliffs on the opposite land are easily seen on a
clear day.</p>

<p>Hence it would have been easier before the days
of astronomical knowledge and compasses to have
reached England, and therefore Ireland and the Orkneys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page243">[243]</span>
than to get to some of the islands in the Mediterranean
itself.<a href="#Footnote93" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor93">[93]</a></p>

<p>It is seen then that it is possible that Semites
might have built our stone monuments between 2000
and 1200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, while it is quite certain that the
Aryans did not build them, if the arch&aelig;ologists are not
widely wrong in their dates.</p>

<p>Let us, then, begin our inquiries by considering the
information available with regard to the Semites. Let
us see in the first instance whether they had stone
monuments, and sacred trees and sacred wells; a
system of worship; and whether this worship was connected
with the sun and stars.</p>

<p>It is fortunate for us in this matter that one of the
most fully equipped scholars which the last century
produced, Robertson Smith, devoted his studies for many
years to <i>The Religion of the Semites</i>, and information on
the points raised is to our hand; all I need do is to
give as shortly as possible a statement of the various
conclusions he had reached on the points to which our
attention may in the first instance be confined. I quote
from his book <i>The Religion of the Semites</i>.</p>

<p>The Semites include the Babylonians, who spoke a
Semitic dialect, for there were Sumerian speaking peoples
among them, Assyrians, Ph&#339;nicians, Hebrews, Arabs
and Aram&aelig;ans, who in ancient times occupied the<span class="pagenum" id="Page244">[244]</span>
fertile lands of Syria, Mesopotamia and Irak from the
Mediterranean coast to the base of the mountains of
Iran and Armenia. They also embrace the inhabitants
of the great Arabian peninsula, which is believed to
have been the centre of dispersion.</p>

<p>The ordinary artificial mark of a Semitic sanctuary
was the sacrificial pillar, cairn, or rude altar (p. 183):
it was a fixed point where, according to primitive rule,
the blood of the offering was applied to the sacred
stones; or where a sacred tree, as we shall see presently,
was hung with gifts; the stones and tree being symbols
of the God (p. 151).</p>

<p>Further, it is certain that the original altar among
the northern Semites was a great unhewn<a href="#Footnote94" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor94">[94]</a> stone, or a
cairn, at which the blood of the victim was shed (p. 185).</p>

<p>Monolithic pillars or cairns of stones are frequently
mentioned in the more ancient parts of the Old Testament
as marking sanctuaries; Shechem, Bethel, Gilead, Gilgal,
Mizpah, Gibeon, and En-Rogel are referred to (p. 186).</p>

<p>There is evidence that in very early times the sanctuary
was a cave (p. 183). The obvious successors of a natural
cave are, (1) an artificial cave made in the earth like
the natural one, and (2) a model or representation of a
cave built of stone, with a small entrance which would
be barred, and covered over with earth, thus protecting
the priests from wild animals and the weather.</p>

<p>The dolmens and cromlechs which are found in the
Semitic area where there are stones doubtless had this
origin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page245">[245]</span></p>

<p>The use of a cave was probably borrowed both by the
Egyptians and Greeks (there is a cave, for instance, at
Eleusis) from the Semites.</p>

<p>In later times, when caves or their equivalents were
no longer in vogue and temples were erected, they
enclosed a Bit-ili or Beth-el, an upright stone, consecrated
by oil.<a href="#Footnote95" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor95">[95]</a></p>

<p>We next learn (pp. 170 and 183) that no Canaanite
high place was complete without its sacred tree standing
beside the altar.</p>

<p>In tree-worship pure and simple as in Arabia, the
tree is adored at an annual feast (? May), when it is
hung with clothes and women&#8217;s ornaments (p. 169).</p>

<p>The tree at Mecca to which offerings are made is
spoken of as a &#8220;tree to hang things on.&#8221;</p>

<p>The references to &#8220;groves&#8221; given in the Bible as associated
with temple worship are misleading, &#8220;groves&#8221;
being a wrong translation of the word Asherah, which was
a pole made of wood which the Jews adopted from the
Canaanites. It was ornamented and perhaps draped, and
was most probably originally a tree. It may have been
used in the &#8220;high places&#8221; because single trees would not
grow there in the East any more than on the moors
in Devon and Cornwall.</p>

<p>The antiquity of this emblem is proved by Smith&#8217;s
statement (p. 171) that in an Assyrian monument from<span class="pagenum" id="Page246">[246]</span>
Khors&#257;b&#257;d an ornamental pole is shown beside a
portable altar. &#8220;Priests stand before it engaged in an
act of worship and touch the pole with their hands or
perhaps anoint it with some liquid substance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The draping of the tree seems to be proved by the passage
which suggested the mistranslation to me before I
wrote to some Hebrew scholars among my friends who
allowed me to consult them. The passage is as follows
(II. Kings, xxiii., 6, <span class="nowrap">7):&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;And he brought out the grove from the house of
the Lord, without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron,
and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it
small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the
graves of the children of the people.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he brake down the houses of the Sodomites, that
were by the house of the Lord, where the women wove
hangings for the grove.&#8221;</p>

<p>To show how little variation there was in the Semitic
practices to those recorded in British folklore I may
state that one of my friends&mdash;one of the revision
committee&mdash;informed me that his impression was that
the Asherah was furnished with pegs or hooks, so that
the garments, &amp;c., might be easily hung on it.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">I next come to the sacred waters. A sacred fountain,
as well as the sacred tree, was a common symbol
at Semitic sanctuaries (p. 183). Nevertheless, they
were sometimes absent, the main place being given
to altar worship. Further, Robertson Smith was of
opinion that this altar worship did not originate with
tree [? or water] worship (p. 170); but still, sacred
wells are among the oldest and most ineradicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page247">[247]</span>
objects of reverence among all the Semites, and were
credited with oracular powers (pp. 128, 154). The
fountain or stream was not a mere adjunct to the
temple, but was itself one of the principal <i>sacra</i> of
the spot (p. 155).</p>

<p>Undoubtedly there were ordeals among other things
at these wells (p. 163). One case is given in Numbers,
v., 17, where the words &#8220;holy water&#8221; occur, and
other water &#8220;that causeth the curse&#8221; is referred to.
Ordeal by water is not unknown among British customs.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that special sanctity was
attached to groups of seven wells (p. 167), and that
one such group was called Thorayga=Pleiades (p. 153).<a href="#Footnote96" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor96">[96]</a>
We may gather from this that one of the most sacred
times for Semitic worship was at the May festival,
marked by the rising of the Pleiades.</p>

<p>Although I do not find many references in Robertson
Smith&#8217;s book as to great festival days, there is other
evidence which shows that the May festival was the
greatest, and represented New Year&#8217;s Day. I have
already shown that the May-November year is the
one recognised in the present Turkish, Armenian and
I believe Persian calendars (p. 29). As this was the
year used at Thebes 3200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, we may take it that
at that time it was universal in W. Asia and the
adjacent lands. The Jews afterwards adopted the
equinoctial year.</p>

<p>It seems highly probable that we may learn from<span class="pagenum" id="Page248">[248]</span>
many passages in the Old Testament what the Semitic
temple practices were generally. There were sacrifices
of men and beasts, burnt offerings, and lighting of
fires, through which the children were made to pass.</p>

<p>I give some references to these fire practices.</p>

<p>&#8220;And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass
through the fire to Molech.&#8221;&mdash;Leviticus, xviii., 21.</p>

<p>&#8220;There shall not be found among you any one that
maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the
fire, or that useth divination, or an observer of times,
or an enchanter, or a witch,</p>

<p>&#8220;Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits,
or a wizard, or a necromancer.&#8221;&mdash;Deuteronomy, xviii.,
10, 11.</p>

<p>&#8220;He walked in the way of the kings of Israel, yea,
and made his son to pass through the fire.&#8221;&mdash;II. Kings,
xvi., 3.</p>

<p>&#8220;And they caused their sons and their daughters to
pass through the fire, and used divination and enchantments.&#8221;&mdash;II.
Kings, xvii., 17.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of
the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his
son or his daughter to pass through the fire to
Molech.&#8221;&mdash;II. Kings, xxiii., 10. (See also 4 and 5.)</p>

<p>Fire sacrifices which were interpreted as offerings of
fragrant smoke were prevalent among the settled Semites
(p. 218). Sacrificial fat was burned on the altar. Smith
remarks: &#8220;This could be done without any fundamental
modification of the old type of sacred stone or altar
pillar, simply by making a hollow on the top to
receive the grease, and there is some reason to think
that fire-altars of this simple kind, which in certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page249">[249]</span>
Ph&#339;nician types are developed into altar candlesticks,
are older than the broad platform altar proper for
receiving a burnt offering&#8221; (p. 364).</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">With regard to the worship of the sun and stars
by the Semites, we read that the Semite addressed his
God as Baal or Bal. The simple form of Baal was
the sun.<a href="#Footnote97" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor97">[97]</a></p>

<p>By the Semites the stars were, on account of their
movements, held to be alive; they were therefore
gods, and it was in consequence of this widespread
belief that the stars were worshipped (p. 127). The
worshippers &#8220;burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, to
the moon and to the planets, and to all the hosts of
heaven&#8221; (II. Kings, xxiii., 5). Job congratulated himself
that &#8220;his heart had not been enticed, nor his mouth
kissed his hand, if he beheld the sun when it shined,
or the moon walking in her brightness&#8221; (Job, xxxi.,
26-27). The worship of the morning star as a god
is the old Semitic conception (Isa., xiv., 12), &#8220;Lucifer
son of the Dawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>We gather from the later practices of the Saracens
that the sacrifices to the morning star could not be
made after the star had disappeared in the dawn.<a href="#Footnote98" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor98">[98]</a>
The God had to be in the presence of the worshippers.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">The Semitic worship was generally carried on in
&#8220;high places&#8221;; in the Babylonian temples built in a
river valley the &#8220;high places&#8221; were secured by building
towers with the sanctuary on the top.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page250">[250]</span></p>

<p>These high places were necessary because exact observations
of the risings of the heavenly bodies formed part
of the ceremonial, and a clear horizon was absolutely
imperative. That this was generally understood and
acted on is well evidenced by the fact that in the Old
Testament the mention of high places is nearly always
associated with the references to the religion of the
Canaanites and other Semitic nations as if the high
places were among the most important points in it.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Other arguments may be founded upon linguistic
considerations. Prof. J. Morris Jones<a href="#Footnote99" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor99">[99]</a> finds that
the syntax of Welsh and Irish differs from that of
other Aryan languages in many important respects, <i>e.g.</i>
the verb is put first in every simple sentence. Prof.
Rhys had suggested that these differences represented
the persistence in Welsh and Irish of the syntax of a
pre-Aryan dialect, and as the anthropologists hold that
the pre-Aryan population of these islands came from
North Africa, it seemed to Prof. Jones that that was
the obvious place to look for the origin of these syntactical
peculiarities. He finds the similarities between
Old Egyptian and neo-Celtic syntax to be astonishing;
he shows that practically all the peculiarities of Welsh
and Irish syntax are found in the Hamitic languages.</p>

<p>This conclusion practically implies that the bulk of
the population of these islands, before the arrival of
the Celts, spoke dialects allied to those of North
Africa. The syntactical peculiarities must have represented<span class="pagenum" id="Page251">[251]</span>
the habits of thought of the people, which survived
in the Celtic vocabulary imposed upon them.</p>

<p>These conclusions were not known to me when I
began to see the necessity of separating the cult of
the June from that of the May year, and the
identity of the conclusions drawn from astronomical
and linguistic data is to me very striking and also
suggests further special inquiries.</p>

<p>It is also worth while to state that the Semites, including
the Hebrews and Ph&#339;nicians, did not burn their
dead. Finally, I may quote a remark made by General
Pitt-Rivers in the paper already referred to:&mdash;&#8220;If we do
not accept one old civilization as the origin of the various
practices, then we must assume accidental origins in each
country.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXIII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE SIMILARITY OF THE SEMITIC AND BRITISH WORSHIPS</span></h2>

<p>I propose in this chapter to bring into juxtaposition
the various British and Semitic-Egyptian practices which
we have so far considered.</p>

<p>I confess I am amazed at the similarities we have
come across in the first cast of the net; we have
found so much that is common to both worships in
connection with all the points we considered separately.
I will, for convenience, deal with the various points
seriatim.</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">1. The cult of sacred stones or cairns.</h3>

<p>The only objection which, so far as I can see, may
be raised to these practices being absolutely common
is the idea among many British arch&aelig;ologists that
the cairns, in which term I include chambered barrows
or dolmens and their skeletons, the cromlechs and stone
passages, were set up for burial and not for worship.
This idea has arisen because some of them have been
used for burials. But I cannot accept this argument,
because since the burials might have taken place at
any time subsequent to their erection they prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page253">[253]</span>
nothing as to the reason of the erection; and further,
if these chambered cairns were meant for burials, there
should be burials in all of them, and yet there are
none in the most majestic of them all, Maeshowe.</p>

<p>Let us consider a few facts in relation to the Semitic
use of cairns referred to on <a href="#Page244">p. 244</a>.</p>

<p>That the cromlechs found both in Britain and Syria&mdash;there
are 780 in Ireland and 700 in Moab&mdash;are the
remains of chambered cairns is pretty clear from the
evidence brought forward by Borlase.<a href="#Footnote100" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor100">[100]</a></p>

<p>Mr. John Bell, of Dundalk, disinterred over sixty
cromlechs from cairns in Ulster. All dolmens were
covered by tumuli according to Mr. Bell and Mr. Lukis.
Monuments called cairns in the earliest Ordnance
Survey have been marked dolmens in subsequent
surveys (<i>e.g.</i> Townland of Leana in Clare) because the
earth covering the stones had disappeared in the
meantime.</p>

<p>Among the evidences of natural and artificial caves
preceding cairns which replaced them are the twenty-four
caves which have been explored in France (<i>op. cit.</i>,
p. 568).<a href="#Footnote101" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor101">[101]</a></p>

<p>Borlase points out with regard to the Irish dolmens<span class="pagenum" id="Page254">[254]</span>
that large tumuli were not essential; all that was
necessary was that the walls of the cell or crypt should
be impervious to the elements and to wild animals.
A creep or passage communicating with the edge of the
mound is common to Ireland, Wales, Portugal and
Brittany (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 428).</p>

<p>The facts that the cairns so often had their open
ends facing the N.E. or S.E., and that the west end
was generally higher, like the naos trilithons at Stonehenge,
must be borne in mind.</p>

<p>Most of what we know of earliest man has been
obtained from their lives in caves; what they ate, the
contemporary fauna and their art are thus known to
us, but caves have not been considered as tombs, though
men have died and left their remains in them.</p>

<p>In the case of a dolmen, however, an artificial cave,
as we shall see, the possibility of people living in them
appears never to have been considered seriously, and
the tomb theory has led to bad reasoning and forced
argument.</p>

<p>When burials are absent it has been suggested that
&#8220;owing to some peculiarity of the soil, the entire of
the human remains have become decomposed, only the
imperishable stone implements entombed with the body
remaining.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote102" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor102">[102]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Spence has pointed out the extreme improbability
of Maeshowe being anything but a temple, and I may
now add on the Semitic model. There were a large
central hall and side rooms for sleeping, a stone door
which could have been opened or shut <i>from the inside</i>,
and a niche for a guard, janitor or hall porter! So<span class="pagenum" id="Page255">[255]</span>
high an authority as Colonel Leslie has pointed out
that neither Maeshowe, New Grange and Dowth on
the Boyne, nor Gavr Innis in Brittany bear any
internal proof of being specially prepared as tombs.<a href="#Footnote103" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor103">[103]</a></p>

<p>There is another point connected with these dolmens
and cromlechs. An origin in the Semitic area easily
explains why in Asia and Britain the dolmens are
so alike, down to small details, such as the perforation
of one of the side stones. Borlase has remarked
also upon the similarity of Indian and Irish dolmens
(<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 755), similar holes also being common to
them. The curious concentric circles, &amp;c., found on
some dolmen stones are common to Assyrian vessels.<a href="#Footnote104" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor104">[104]</a></p>

<p>The most philosophical study of this question I have
seen<a href="#Footnote105" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor105">[105]</a> certainly suggests that much light may be expected
from this source.</p>

<p>Part of the cult of the sacred stones was the ceremony
of <i>anointing them</i>. Robertson Smith (p. 214) gives
us the meaning and history of anointing among the
Semites, and notes its continuation from Jacob&#8217;s pouring
oil on sacred stones at Bethel, through the time of
Pausanias to that of the Pilgrims of the fourth century <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span></p>

<p>The anointing of stones was certainly carried on in<span class="pagenum" id="Page256">[256]</span>
ancient times in Britain and Brittany. Baring-Gould
tells us:<a href="#Footnote106" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor106">[106]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Formerly the menhir was beplastered with oil and
honey and wax, and this anointing of the stones was
condemned by the bishops. In certain places the local
clergy succeeded in diverting the practice to the
Churches. There are still some in Lower Brittany whose
exterior walls are strung with wax lines arranged in
festoons and patterns.</p>

<p>&#8220;In some places childless women still rub themselves
against menhirs, expecting thereby to be cured of
barrenness, but in others, instead, they rub themselves
against stone images of saints.&#8221;</p>

<p>When I visited the Cave of Elephanta in 1871 I was
told that the barren women of Bombay visit the cave
once a year and anoint the standing stone in the
chief chamber. In Egypt they still rub their bodies on
the Colossi.</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">2. Sacred fires.</h3>

<p>Among the Semites the sacrificial fat was burned on
the altar. And we have seen that &#8220;this could be done
without any fundamental modification of the old type
of sacred stone or altar pillar, simply by making a hollow
on the top to receive the grease.&#8221;<a href="#Footnote107" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor107">[107]</a></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 49</span>.&mdash;Cresset-stone, Lewannick.
From Baring-Gould&#8217;s
<i>Strange Survivals</i>.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>Baring-Gould<a href="#Footnote108" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor108">[108]</a> has written on the question of
sacrificial and sacred fires in ancient times in Britain, and
points out that there still remain in some of our
churches (in Cornwall, York and Dorset) the contrivances&mdash;now
called cresset-stones&mdash;used. They are<span class="pagenum" id="Page257">[257]</span>
blocks of stone with cups hollowed out precisely as
described by Robertson Smith. Some are placed in
lamp-niches furnished with flues.
On these he remarks (p. <span class="nowrap">122):&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Now although these lamps and
cressets had their religious signification,
yet this religious signification
was an afterthought. The
origin of them lay in the necessity
of there being in every place a
central light, from which light
could at any time be borrowed.&#8221;</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">3. The cult of the sacred tree.</h3>

<p>I have shown that the sacred
trees in Britain, whether rowan, thorn or mistletoe,
were at their best at the times of the festivals at
which they were chiefly worshipped. Mrs. J. H.
Philpot, in her valuable book on &#8220;the sacred tree,&#8221;
gives us the names of some used in different countries;
it would be interesting to inquire whether the same consideration
applies to them in the Semitic and other areas.</p>

<p>There seems to be no doubt that the Semitic Asherah
was the precursor of the British Maypole, even to its
dressing of many coloured ribands, and from the Maypole
customs we may infer something of the Semitic
practices which have not come down to us. Even
&#8220;Jack o&#8217; the Green&#8221; may eventually be traced to
Al-Khidr (<a href="#Page29">p. 29</a>) of the old May festivals.</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">4. The cult of the sacred well.</h3>

<p>Here we find only trifling differences. The chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page258">[258]</span>
one is the use of pins in Britain. If we knew more
about the Asherah with its hooks this difference might
disappear.</p>

<p>It has been pointed out by several authors that the
worship of wells and water would be most likely to
arise in a dry and thirsty land.</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">5. The time of the chief festivals.</h3>

<p>Here we find beyond all question that the festival
times were the same to begin with. May is the chief
month both in West Asia and West Europe.</p>

<p>It was not till a subsequent time that June and
December were added in Egypt and Britain, and April
and September among the Jews.</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">6. The characteristics of the festivals.</h3>

<p>Here again is precise agreement. The list I gave
on <a href="#Page205">p. 205</a> of what can be gathered from British folklore
is identical with the statements as to Semitic
practices which I quoted from Robertson Smith in the
last chapter.</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">7. The worship in high places.</h3>

<p>Absolute identity; and from this we can gather that
the ancient condition of the high places wherever
selected for temple worship was as treeless as it is
now; otherwise the observations of sun- and star-rise
and -set would be greatly interfered with.</p>

<p>Of course, there may have been &#8220;groves&#8221; associated
with, but away from, sanctuaries in both Semitic and
British areas: but it is not impossible that much which
has been written on this subject with regard to Britain<span class="pagenum" id="Page259">[259]</span>
and the &#8220;Druids&#8221; may have been suggested in part by
the erroneous translation of Asherah to which I have
referred. It has also been stated that an early transcriber
who, in error, substituted lucus for locus may
also be held partly responsible, even if lucus does not
mean a clearing in a grove, as some maintain.</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">8. The god or gods worshipped.</h3>

<p>The year-gods in Babylonia and Egypt respectively
were Baal and Thoth. It is worth while to inquire
whether either name has made its appearance as a
loan-word in the traditions of Western Europe.</p>

<p>About Baal there can be no question as to the
coincidence, whether accidental, as some philologists
affirm, or not.</p>

<p>We find Bel or Baal common to the two areas. Mr.
Borlase informs us (<i>op. cit.</i>, p. 1164) that in Western
Europe Bel, Beal, Balor, Balder, and Phol, Fal, F&aacute;il
are the equivalents of the Semitic Baal. Balus, indeed,
is named as the first king of Orkney. A May worship
is connected with all the above. Beltaine and many
variants describe the fires lighted at the festival, and
it is worthy of note that although this fire worship
has been extended to the solstitial ceremonials in June,
the name Baltaine has never been applied to it at that
time except by writers who think that the term &#8220;midsummer&#8221;
may be applied indiscriminately to the beginning
of May and the end of June.</p>

<p>I next deal with the Egyptian year-god Thoth. In
Greece he became Hermes, among the Romans Mercury.
In this connection I can most usefully refer to Rhys&#8217;s
Hibbert Lectures and his chapter on the Gaulish<span class="pagenum" id="Page260">[260]</span>
Pantheon. He tells us (p. 5) that &#8220;Mercury is the god
with whom the monuments lead one to begin.&#8221; There is
also mention of a god Toutates or Teutates, and a
Toutius, who might have been a public official (? priest
of Toutates). Only Celtic or other later origins of the
words are suggested; it is not said whether the
possible Egyptian root has been considered.</p>

<p>We may even, I think, go further and ask whether
some of the constellations were not figured as in Egypt,
otherwise it is difficult to account for the horror of the
black pig (<a href="#Page195">p. 195</a>) at Hallowe&#8217;en. The whole Egyptian
story is told in my <i>Dawn of Astronomy</i><a href="#Footnote109" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor109">[109]</a> in connection
with the worship of Set, that is the stars visible at
night, blotted out at dawn by the rising sun, or becoming
predominant after sunset.</p>

<h3 class="leftnobot">9. The worship of the sun and stars.</h3>

<p>Here also, as I have shown, is complete agreement.
The same astronomical methods have been employed for
the same purpose. The chief difference lies in the fact
that by lapse of time the precessional movement caused
different stars to be observed as clock stars or to herald
the sunrise on the chief ceremonial days.</p>

&#8220;France, indeed, furnishes us with a stepping-stone, as it were,
between the natural cave and the dolmen in certain artificial caves
which offer comparison both with the former and the latter... the
natural cave was scooped out into a large chamber or chambers either
by the swirling of water pent up in the limestone or other yielding rock
and finding its way out through some narrow crevice. The ground
plan and section, therefore, is that of an <i>all&eacute;e couverte</i> with a

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXIV</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE MAY-YEAR IN SOUTH-WEST CORNWALL</span></h2>

<p>The previous pages of this volume have apparently
dealt with two distinct subjects; the use of the British
monuments on the orientation theory, and the folklore
and tradition which enable us to get some glimpses into
the lives, actions, habits and beliefs of the early inhabitants
of these islands, and the region whence these
early inhabitants had migrated.</p>

<p>But although these subjects are apparently distinct,
I think my readers will agree that the study of each
has led to an identical result, namely, that in early
times it was a question of the May year, and that the
solstitial year was introduced afterwards. This was the
chief revelation of the monuments when they were
studied from the astronomical point of view.</p>

<p>Without confirmation from some other sources this
result might have been considered as doubtful, and the
orientation theory might have been thought valueless. It
has, however, been seen that folklore and tradition confirm
it up to the hilt. I think it may be said, therefore,
that the theory I put forward in this book touching the
astronomical use of our ancient temples is so far justified.</p>

<p>The British monuments I had considered before this
appeal to tradition was made were the circles at Stonehenge,<span class="pagenum" id="Page262">[262]</span>
Stenness, The Hurlers and Stanton Drew, and
the avenues on Dartmoor. These were studied generally,
the main special result being that to which I have referred;
we not only found alignments to sunrise and
sunset on the critical quarter-days of the May years, but
we found alignments to the stars which should have
been observed either at rising or setting to control the
morning sacrifices.</p>

<p>But this inquiry had left out of account several circles
in south-west Cornwall, of which I had vaguely heard
but never seen. When I had written the previous
chapters showing how fully May-year practices are referred
to in the folklore of that part of the country, I
determined to visit the circles, dealing with them as test
objects in regard to this special branch of orientation.
I had not time to make a complete survey; this
I must leave to others; but with the help so readily
afforded me, which I shall acknowledge in its proper
place, I thought it possible in a brief visit to see
whether or not there were any May-year alignments. In
the following chapters I will give an account of the
observations made, but before doing so, in order to prove
how solid the evidence afforded by the Cornish monuments
is, I will state the details of the local astronomical conditions
depending upon the latitude of the Land&#8217;s End
region, N. 50&deg;. In the chapter containing some astronomical
hints to arch&aelig;ologists I referred (<a href="#Page122">p. 122</a>) to the
solstice conditions for Stenness beyond John o&#8217; Groat&#8217;s,
because those conditions afforded a special case, the
solstice being determined by the arrival of the sun at its
highest or lowest declination, which happens on particular
dates which recur each year. But with regard to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page263">[263]</span>
May year, during the first week of May the sun&#8217;s
declination is changing by over a quarter of a degree
daily, so that we must not expect to find the declination
of 16&deg; 20&#8242; (see <a href="#Page22">p. 22</a>) rigidly adhered to.</p>

<p>As I have shown (<a href="#Page23">p. 23</a>), the sun&#8217;s passage through this
declination four times on its annual path on the dates
stated accurately divides the year into four equal parts.
But this accuracy might have been neglected by the
early observers, so that, for instance, the sun&#8217;s position
on the 4th or 8th of May instead of that on the 6th
might have been chosen as being in greater harmony
with the agricultural conditions at the place.</p>

<p>The conditions of the sunrise from John o&#8217; Groat&#8217;s to
Land&#8217;s End, 2&#8242; of the sun being visible above the sky-line,
can be gathered from the following <span class="nowrap">diagram:&mdash;</span></p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXV</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE MERRY MAIDENS CIRCLE (LAT. 50&deg; 4&#8242; N.)</span></h2>

<p>One of the best preserved circles that I know of is
near Penzance. It is called the Merry Maidens<a href="#Footnote110" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor110">[110]</a> (Dawns-Maen),
and is thus described by Lukis<a href="#Footnote111" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor111">[111]</a>
(p. <span class="nowrap">1):&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;This very perfect Circle, which is 75 feet 8 inches
in diameter, stands in a cultivated field which slopes
gently to the south.</p>

<p>&#8220;It consists of 19 granite stones placed at tolerably
regular distances from each other, but there is a gap
on the east side, where another stone was most
probably once erected.</p>

<p>&#8220;Many of the stones are rectangular in plan at the
ground level, vary from 3 feet 3 inches to 4 feet in
height, and are separated by a space of from 10 to 12<span class="pagenum" id="Page266">[266]</span>
feet. There is a somewhat shorter interval between
four of the stones on the south side.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the vicinity of this monument are two monoliths
called the Pipers; another called Goon-Rith; a
holed stone (not long ago there were two others); and
several [5] Cairns.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lukis thus describes the <span class="nowrap">&#8220;Pipers&#8221;:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;Two rude stone pillars of granite stand erect, 317
feet apart, and about 400 yards to the north-east of
the Circle of Dawns-Maen. No. 1 is 15 feet high, 4
feet 6 inches in breadth, and has an average thickness
of 22 inches, and is 2 feet 9 inches out of the
perpendicular. The stone is of a laminated nature, and
a thin fragment has flaked off from the upper part.
No. 2 is 13 feet 6 inches high, and is much split
perpendicularly. At the ground level its plan in
section is nearly a square of about 3 feet.&#8221;</p>

<p>Goon-Rith is next described:&mdash;&#8220;No. 3 is naturally
of a rectangular form in plan, and is 10 feet 6 inches
in height. The land on which it stands is called
Goon-Rith, or Red Downs. The upper part of the
stone is of irregular shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>Borlase, in his <i>History of Cornwall</i> (1769), only
mentions the circle, but W. C. Borlase, in his <i>N&aelig;nia
Cornubi&aelig;</i> (1872), gives a very rough plan including
the stones before mentioned and several barrows, some
of which have been ploughed up.</p>

<p>At varying distances from the circle and in widely
different azimuths are other standing stones, ancient
crosses and holed stones, while some of the barrows
can still be traced.</p>

<p>The descriptions of the locality given by Borlase<span class="pagenum" id="Page267">[267]</span>
and Lukis, however, do not exhaust the points of
interest. Edmonds<a href="#Footnote112" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor112">[112]</a>
writes as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;A cave still perfect... is on an eminence in the
tenement of Boleit (Boleigh) in St. Buryan, and about
a furlong south-west of the village of Trewoofe (Trove).
It is called the &#8216;Fowgow,&#8217; and consists of a trench 6
feet deep and 36 long, faced on each side with
unhewn and uncemented stones, across which, to serve
as a roof, long stone posts or slabs are laid covered
with thick turf, planted with furze. The breadth of
the cave is about 5 feet. On its north-west side, near
the south-west end, a narrow passage leads into a
branch cave of considerable extent, constructed in the
same manner. At the south-west end is an entrance
by a descending path; but this, as well as the cave
itself, is so well concealed by the furze that the whole
looks like an ordinary furze break without any way
into it. The direction of the line of this cave is about
north-east and south-west, which line, if continued
towards the south-west, would pass close to the two
ancient pillars called the Pipers, and the Druidical
temple of Dawns Myin, all within half of a mile.&#8221;</p>

<p>This fougou is situated on a hill on the other side
of the Lamorna Valley, near the village of Castallack,
and the site of the Roundago shown in the 1-inch
Ordnance map.</p>

<p>Borlase<a href="#Footnote113" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor113">[113]</a> says that many similar caves were to be
seen &#8220;in these parts&#8221; in his time, and others had
been destroyed by converting the stones to other uses.</p>

<p>There is evidence that the circle conditions at the
Merry Maidens were once similar to those at Stenness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page268">[268]</span>
Stanton Drew, the Hurlers, Tregaseal and Botallack,
that is that there was more than one, the numbers
running from 2 to 7. Mr. Horton Bolitho, without
whose aid in local investigations this chapter in all
probability would never have been written, in one
of his visits came across &#8220;the oldest inhabitant,&#8221;
who remembered a second circle. He said, &#8220;It was
covered with furze and never shown to antiquarians&#8221;;
ultimately the field in which it stood was ploughed up
and the stones removed. It is to prevent a similar
fate happening to the &#8220;Merry Maidens&#8221; themselves
that Lord Falmouth will not allow the field in
which they stand to be ploughed, and all antiquarians
certainly owe him a debt of gratitude for this and
other proofs of his interest in antiquities. Mr.
Bolitho carefully marked the site thus indicated on a
copy of the 25-inch map. I shall subsequently show
that the circle which formerly existed here, like the
others named, was located on an important sight-line.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton Bolitho was good enough to make
a careful examination of the barrows A and B of
Borlase.<a href="#Footnote114" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor114">[114]</a> In A (S. 69&deg; W.) he found a long stone
still lying in the barrow, suggesting that the barrow
had been built round it, and that the apex of the
barrow formed a new alignment. In B there is
either another recumbent long stone or the capstone
of a dolmen. This suggests work for the local antiquarians.</p>

<p>I should state that there may be some doubt about
barrow A, for there are two not far from each other
with approximate azimuths S. 69&deg; W. and S. 64&deg; W.<span class="pagenum" id="Page269">[269]</span>
The destruction of these and other barrows was probably
the accompaniment of the reclamation of waste lands
and the consequent
interference with
antiquities which
in Cornwall has
mostly taken place
since 1800.</p>

<p>But it did not
begin then, nor has
it been confined to
barrows. Dr. Borlase,
in his parochial
memoranda under
date September 29,
1752, describes a
monolith 20 feet
above ground, and
planted 4 feet in it,
the &#8220;Men Peru&#8221;
(stone of sorrow)
in the parish of
Constantine. A farmer
acknowledged
that he had cut it
up, and had made
twenty gate-posts
out of it.</p>

<p>My wife and I
visited the Merry
Maidens at Easter,
1905, for the purpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page270">[270]</span>
of making a reconnaissance. Mr. Horton Bolitho
and Mr. Cornish were good enough to accompany us.</p>

<p>On my return to London I began work on the
25-inch Ordnance map, and subsequently Colonel R. C.
Hellard, R.E., director of the Ordnance Survey, was
kind enough to send me the true azimuths of the
Pipers. In October, 1905, Mr. Horton Bolitho and
Captain Henderson, whose help at the Hurlers I have
already had an opportunity of acknowledging, made
a much more complete survey of the adjacent standing
stones and barrows.</p>

<p>In this survey they not only made use of the
25-inch map, but of the old plan given by W. C.
Borlase dating from about 1870. Although the outstanding
stones shown by Borlase remain, some of
the barrows indicated by him have disappeared.</p>

<p>In January, 1906, my wife and I paid other visits
to the monuments, and Mr. Horton Bolitho was
again good enough to accompany us. Thanks to him
permission had been obtained to break an opening in
the high wall-boundary which prevented any view
along the &#8220;Pipers&#8221; sight-line. I may here add that
unfortunately in Cornwall the field boundaries often
consist of high stone walls topped by furze, so that
the outstanding stones once visible from the circles
can now no longer be seen from them; another
trouble is that from this cause the angular height of
the sky-line along the alignment cannot be measured
in many cases.</p>

<p>I will now proceed to refer to the chief sight-lines
seriatim. The first is that connecting the circle which
still exists with the site of the ancient one. On this<span class="pagenum" id="Page271">[271]</span>
line exactly I found four points, a barrow (L) which
Borlase had missed (further from the circle than his
barrow A), the site, the present circle, and the
fougou; azimuth from centre of circle N. 64&deg; E.
and S. 64&deg; W. This is the May-year line found at
Stonehenge, Stenness, the Hurlers and Stanton Drew.</p>

<p>In connection with this there is another sight-line
which must not be passed over; from the circle the
bearing of the church of St. Burian is about N. 64&deg; W.;
like the fougou it is situated on a hill, and near
it are ancient crosses which I suspect were menhirs
first and crosses afterwards.<a href="#Footnote115" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor115">[115]</a> However this may be,
we see in this azimuth of 64&deg; three times repeated
that the May and August sunrises and sunsets and
the February and November sunsets were provided for.</p>

<p>With regard to the other sight-lines I will begin
with that of the Pipers, as it is quite obviously
connected with the eastern circle only; the stones
could not have been seen from the other on account
of rising ground. The barrow shown in this direction
by Borlase has now entirely disappeared, and the
earth has evidently been spread over the surrounding<span class="pagenum" id="Page272">[272]</span>
field; its surface is therefore higher than formerly, so
that when the opening was made in the wall the top
of the nearest piper could not be seen from the centre
of the circle; an elevation of about 2 feet from the
ground level was necessary. Walking straight from
the circle to the first piper, the second piper was
exactly in a line, though at a much lower level. This
showed that the Ordnance values were not quite
accurate, which was not to be wondered at as no
direct observation had been possible. I therefore
adopted the mean of the Ordnance values as the true
<span class="nowrap">azimuth:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>The sky-line from the centre of the circle was defined
by the site of the vanished barrow, angular elevation
20&#8242;, and it is highly probable that the function of the
barrow when built was to provide a new sight-line when
the star-rise place was no longer exactly pointed out by
the piper line.</p>

<p>With these data the star in question was Capella, dec.
29&deg; 58&#8242; N., heralding the February sunrise, 2160 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>I next come to the famous menhir Goon-Rith. The
conditions are as follows:&mdash;from the circle Az. S. 81&deg; 35&#8242;
W. Altitude of sky-line 34&#8242;.</p>

<p>Concerning this alignment from the circle, it may be
stated that it cuts across many ancient stones, including
one resembling a rock basin or laver, and another either
a holed stone or the socket of a stone cross. I suspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page273">[273]</span>
also the presence in old days of a holy well attached
to the circle, for there is a pool of water in a depression
which is shown in the 25-inch map.</p>

<p>I regard it as quite possible that we are here in
presence of the remains of a cursus, an old <i>via sacra</i>,
for processions between the circle and the monolith.</p>

<p>I have not been able to find any astronomical use for
this stone from the circle or from the site of the old
one, but if we suppose it to have been used like the
Barnstone at Stenness for observations <i>over</i> the circle its
object at once becomes obvious.</p>

<p>From the azimuth given, the declination of the star
was 5&deg; 24&#8242; N. Now this was the position of the Pleiades
<span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> 1960, when they would have warned the rising of
the May sun.</p>

<p>So that it is possible that the erection of the Pipers
and of Goon-Rith took place at about the same time, and
represent the first operations.</p>

<p>The next alignment has an azimuth of S. 69&deg; W.
from the circle; it would be the same within a degree
from the site of the one which has disappeared; altitude
of sky-line 32&#8242;; this line is to a stone cross on rising
ground,<a href="#Footnote116" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor116">[116]</a> doubtless a re-dressing of an old menhir, and
on the line nearer the circle are the remains of a barrow.</p>

<p>With these data the star in question was Antares,
dec. S. 13&deg; 18&#8242;, heralding the May sunrise 1310
<span class="smcapall">B.C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page274">[274]</span></span></p>

<p>There is another stone cross defining a line az.
N. 11&deg; 45&#8242; E. from the circle, altitude of sky-line about
the same as along the Piper azimuth; an intervening
house prevents measurement. These values give us N. dec.
38&deg; 46&#8242;, referring to Arcturus warning the August sunrise
in 1640 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The three alignments already referred to, then, give
us the warning stars for three out of the four quarter-days
of the May year.</p>

<p>There is still another stone cross, Az. N. 82&deg; 5&#8242; W.,
hills about 34&#8242;. This has no connection with the May
year, but may refer to the equinoctial one.</p>

<p>W. C. Borlase refers to several holed stones. The
data for two of these, supplied by Capt. Henderson, are
as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Azimuths near these have been noted before at other
circles, and it must not be forgotten that as the holed
stones on my view were used for observation, these
azimuths must be reversed, since it is probable that the
observations were made over the circle. If this were so,
then S.E. would be changed into N.W., and we should
get N. 50&deg; 33&#8242; W. indicating the solstitial sunset. Similarly,
S.W. would become N.E., and we should have
N. 79&deg; 25&#8242; E., possibly a Pleiades alignment.</p>

<p>I have brought together in the following table all
the sight-lines so far referred to. Where the altitude
of the sky-line has been measured it is marked

I may here remark that &#8220;9 maidens&#8221; is very common as a name
for a circle in Cornwall. It is a short title for 19 maidens. Lukis
implies that Dawns-Maen once consisted of 20 stones. If all the
circles followed suit it would be interesting to note if the present
number of 19 is always associated with a gap on the eastern side.
The &#8220;pipers&#8221; are, of course, the musicians who keep the maidens
merry, as does the &#8220;blind fiddler&#8221; at Boscowen-un Circle.</p>

In <span class="smcapall">A.D.</span> 658 a council assembled at Nantes decreed:&mdash;&#8220;As in
remote places and in woodlands there stand certain stones which the
people often worship, and at which vows are made, and to which
oblations are presented&mdash;we decree that they be all cast down and
concealed in such a place that their worshippers may not be able to
find them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now the carrying out of their order was left to the country
parsons, and partly because they had themselves been brought up to
respect these stones, and partly because the execution of the decree
would have brought down a storm upon their heads, they contented
themselves with putting a cross on top of the stones.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Book of
Brittany</i>, by Baring-Gould, p. 20.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote116"></a><a href="#FNanchor116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a>
With regard to this Mr. Horton Bolitho has sent me the
following note:&mdash;&#8220;The rising ground here is called locally &#8216;Lanine
Hill&#8217; (spelt Lanyon and pronounced Lanine); this is worth noticing, as
it is the same name as the dolmen six or seven miles away from Boleit,
and in the same district as the Men an T&ocirc;l and Boskednan Circle, to
say nothing of Lannion in Brittany. Lan signifies something sacred,
the place of the saint, or belonging to the saint.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXVI</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE TREGASEAL CIRCLES (LAT. 50&deg; 8&#8242; 25&#8243; N.,
LONG. 5&deg; 39&#8242; 25&#8243; W.)</span></h2>

<p>There are two circles situated on Truthwall Common
near to Tregaseal and not far from St. Just;
the one is nearly to the east of the other, and there
are outstanding stones, including four holed stones,
and several barrows. The eastern temple has a
diameter of 69 feet, and includes, at the present time,
nine erect and four prostrate stones; the original
structure seems to have contained twenty-eight stones
according to Lukis.</p>

<p>My wife and I visited the region in January, 1906,
but previously to our going Mr. Horton Bolitho,
accompanied by Mr. Thomas, whose knowledge of the
local antiquities is very great, had explored the region
and taught us what to observe.</p>

<p>The chief interest appears to lie on the N.E. quadrant,
where, in addition to a famous longstone on a
hill about a mile away, the nest of holed stones and
several of the barrows are located. Carn Kenidjack, a
famous landmark, lies to the north.</p>

<p>Of the two circles, I confined my attention almost
exclusively to the eastern one, as the other is in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page278">[278]</span>
fragmentary condition, though it is still traceable. It
is hidden almost entirely from the eastern circle by
a modern hedge.</p>

<p>Mr. Horton Bolitho, who accompanied us in January,
has again visited the spot, with Mr. Thomas, for the
purpose of further exploration, and determining the
angular height of the sky-line along the different
alignments, which I have plotted from the 6-inch and
25-inch maps. My readers will therefore see that my
part of the work has been a small one, and that they
are chiefly indebted to those I have named.</p>

<p>No theodolite survey has as yet been made for determining
the azimuths and the height of the hills. The
following approximate azimuths have been determined
by myself from a 25-inch map, and the elevations by
Mr. Horton Bolitho by means of a miner&#8217;s dial.</p>

<p>Regarding the possible solstitial alignments, the
declinations obtained may be neglected until the
azimuths and angular heights of the hills have been
determined with a good theodolite. A change of
-10&#8242; in the angular elevation, and hence about that
in the resulting declination, would bring the date
given by the barrows to about 2000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>The position of the Longstone is well worthy of
attention. Several very fine monuments which mark
the surrounding horizon are visible from it in azimuths
with which other monuments have made us familiar.

<p>The May-sun alignment, it may be noted, differs
from that from the circle. The heights of hills when
determined may give us the same solar declination;
that now used gives the declination for April 28 and
August 15 in our present calendar.</p>

<p>Regarding the alignment on Lanyon Quoit, it need
only be pointed out that the Pleiades date obtained
is some 200 years after the date obtained for the
analagous alignment from the circle, showing that if
these two monuments&mdash;the Tregaseal circle and the
Longstone&mdash;have any relationship, the removal to the
high plain, now known as Woon Gumpus and Boswen
Commons, was an afterthought improvement.</p>

<p>I next come to the holed stones, not only the nest
of them not far from the circle, but the famous
M&ecirc;n-an-tol itself.</p>

<p>I had heard before going to Tregaseal that the four
holed stones shown on the Ordnance map had been
knocked down and set up again (not necessarily in
their old places) two or three times. Mr. Horton
Bolitho and Mr. Thomas, however, in their examination
were convinced that the largest of them has never
been moved. They also express the belief that the
others are not more than a foot or so from their
original positions, and that this change is only due
to their re-erection by Mr. Cornish after they had
fallen down. So far I have heard nothing of the
direction of the hole in the stone which retains its
original position.</p>

<p>Another interesting matter is that the explorers in
question were able to trace an ancient stone alignment
from the circle to the holed stones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page283">[283]</span></p>

<p>I have long held that these holed stones were
arrangements for determining an alignment. The
famous Odin stone at Stenness, long since disappeared,
was, if we may trust the very definite statements made
about its position, used to observe the Barnstone in one
direction and the chief circle in the other.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page284">[284]</span></p>

<p>The azimuths suggest that theodolite measures may
show that the Tregaseal stones might have been used
in the same way; they, the Longstone and Lanyon
Quoit, are in nearly the same straight line, the alignment,
holed stones to Longstone and Lanyon Quoit,
being N. 67&deg; E., so that the May sunrise may have
been noted in this way.</p>

<p>Several other monuments, <i>e.g.</i>, Ch&ucirc;n Castle and
Cromlech, are to be found in the immediate neighbourhood
of the Tregaseal circle and the Longstone,
but these will have to await further investigation as to
their character and antiquity before any conclusions
concerning their astronomical use can be deduced.</p>

<p>Not only do we find in this neighbourhood the nest
of holed stones to which I have referred, but the M&ecirc;n-an-tol,
the most famous of them all, in England at all
events. This, then, is the place to say a few words
about them. I have before stated my opinion that
these stones, instead of being used as slaughter stones
or posts at which to tie up the victim before sacrifice,
or in any other similar employment, were really sighting
stones to enable an alignment to be easily picked
up. As such these were, of course, treated as sacred,
and hence the folk-lore connected with them. This
folk-lore seems to be most complete in the case of the
famous stone of Odin at Stenness, so I condense Mr.
Spence&#8217;s account of it.</p>

<p>Children brought to the stone at Beltaine and Midsummer,
after being carried sunwise round the holy
well were passed through the hole as a protection against
the powers of the evil one. Marriage ceremony consisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page286">[286]</span>
of joining hands through the hole, a vow held as
sacred as the legal marriage of to-day. Pains in the
head cured by inserting the head in the cavity, cure of
palsy in children. Children and adults travelled many
miles to secure relief in this way.</p>

<p>At the M&ecirc;n-an-tol the curative effects could only be
obtained by crawling through the aperture, which is of
considerable size.</p>

<p>As a rule, however, the aperture is much more
restricted. The general size of the holed stone and the
position of the aperture in it may be well gathered from
the fact that almost all of them have been used for
gateposts, and are now to be seen fulfilling that function.
In some cases the old special use can be inferred,
but in others this is more difficult, as the stones have
been shifted or slewed round, or the ancient monument
to which the sighting stone was directed has
disappeared.</p>

<p>The astronomical origin of the M&ecirc;n-an-tol, which
obviously has never been disturbed, is quite obvious.
<a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a> (from Lukis) shews that it was arranged along
the May year alignment, the advent of May and August,
February and November being indicated by the shadows
cast by the stones through the aperture on to the
opposite ones.</p>

<p>To the south-west the alignment for the February and
November sunsets passes exactly over Ch&ucirc;n Castle.</p>

<p>The &#8220;Tolmen&#8221; near Gweek, Constantine, another
famous holed stone 7 feet 9 inches high and with an
aperture of 17 inches, is according to a magnetic bearing
I took last Easter parallel to the M&ecirc;n-an-tol, and doubtless
was used for the same purpose.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXVII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">SOME OTHER CORNISH MONUMENTS</span></h2>

<h3><i>Boscawen-un</i>, <i>N. Lat.</i> 50&deg; 5&#8242; 20&#8243;</h3>

<p>My wife and I visited Boscawen-un on a pouring
day, when it was impossible to make any observations.
Mr. Horton Bolitho, who was with us, introduced us
to the tenant of Boscawen-noon&mdash;Mr. Hannibal Rowe&mdash;who
very kindly, in spite of the bad weather, took
us to the circle and the stone cross to the N.E. of it.</p>

<p>Lukis thus described this
<span class="nowrap">monument:<a href="#Footnote118" id="FNanchor118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;The enclosed ground on which this circle stands is
uncultivated and heathy, and slopes gently to the
south. Twenty years ago a hedge ran across it and
bisected the circle.</p>

<p>&#8220;This monument is composed of nineteen standing
stones, and is of an oval form, the longer diameter
being 80 feet and the shorter 71 feet 6 inches. One of
the stones is a block of quartz 4 feet high, and the rest,
which are of granite, vary from 2 feet 9 inches to 4 feet
7 inches in height. On the west side there is a gap,
whence it is probable that a stone has been removed.
Within the area, 9 feet to the south-west from the
centre, is a tall monolith, 8 feet out of the ground,
which inclines to the north-east, and is 3 feet 3 inches
out of the perpendicular.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page288">[288]</span></p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig59">

</div><!--image-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page289">[289]</span></p>

<p>&#8220;In 1594 Camden describes this monument as consisting
of nineteen stones, 12 feet from each other, with
one much larger than the rest in the centre. It must
have been much in the same condition then as
now. As he does not say that the monolith enclosed
within it was inclined, it is possible that it was upright
at that time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Stukeley&#8217;s supposition was that it originally
stood upright, and that &#8216;somebody digging by it to find
treasure disturbed it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the north-east side there are two fallen
stones which Dr. Borlase, in 1749, imagined to have
formed part of a Cromlech. It is more probable that
they are the fragments of a second pillar which was
placed to the north-east of the centre, and as far from
it as the existing one is. There are instances, I believe,
of two pillars occupying similar positions within a circle.
One of the stones, that marked <span class="smcapall">C</span> in my plan, on the
eastern side of the ring, was prostrate in the Doctor&#8217;s
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;At a short distance to the south-east and south-west
there are cairns, which have been explored.&#8221;</p>

<p>For this monument I have used the 6-inch map, as
the circle lies nearly at the centre, and all the outstanding
stones are within its limits. The heights of
the sky-line were measured by Mr. H. Bolitho at a
subsequent visit with a miner&#8217;s dial; the resulting<span class="pagenum" id="Page290">[290]</span>
declinations have been calculated by Mr. Rolston. A
theodolite survey will doubtless revise some of <span class="nowrap">them:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I gather from a report which Mr. H. Bolitho has
been good enough to send me that modern hedges and
farming operations have changed the conditions of the
sight-lines, so that 1 and 3 are just invisible from the
circle. This is by no means the only case in which the
sighting stone has just been hidden over the brow of
a hill and in which signals from an observer on the
brow itself have been suggested, or a <i>via sacra</i> to the
brow from the circle; there are many monoliths in this
direction which certainly never belonged to the circle.</p>

<p>From the menhir P (No. 2) a fine view is obtained
from N. to S. through E., so that the Blind Fiddler
and the two large menhirs, and almost the circle, are
visible. The curious shapes of 1 and 2 are noted, the
east face vertical and the west boundary curved, like
several sighting stones on Dartmoor.</p>

<p>The circle itself has several peculiarities. In the
first place, as shown by Lukis, it is not circular,
the diameters being about 85 and 65 feet; the minor
axis runs through the pillar stone in the centre
and the &#8220;fallen stones&#8221; of Dr. Borlase towards the
&#8220;stone cross&#8221; (which is no cross but a fine menhir)
in Az. N. 43&deg; 15&#8242; E. This would suggest that this was
the original alignment in 2250 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, but against this is
the fact that the two stones of the circle between
which the &#8220;fallen stones&#8221; lie are more carefully squared
than the rest. It is true, however, that this might
have been done afterwards, and this seems probable,
for they are closer together than the other circle
stones.</p>

<p>The one quartz stone occupies an azimuth S. 66&deg; W.
It was obviously placed in a post of honour. As a<span class="pagenum" id="Page292">[292]</span>
matter of fact, from it the May sun was seen to rise
over the centre of the circle.</p>

<p>As there are both at Tregaseal and Boscawen-un
alignments suggesting the observation of the summer
solstice sunrise, it is desirable here to refer to the
azimuths as calculated. For this purpose <a href="#Fig60">Fig. 60</a> has
been prepared, which shows these for lat. 50&deg; both at
the present day and at the date of the restoration at
Stonehenge.</p>

<p>My readers should compare this with <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>, which
gives the solstice sunrise conditions of Stenness in
Lat. N. 59&deg;. Such a comparison will show how useless
it is to pursue these inquiries without taking the latitude
and the height of the sky-line into account.</p>

<h3>&#8220;<i>Stripple Stones</i>&#8221; (lat. 50&deg; 32&#8242; 50&#8243; N., long.
4&deg; 37&#8242; W.)</h3>

<p>This is a very remarkable circle consisting of 5 erect
and 11 prostrate stones situated on a circular level
platform 175 feet in diameter on the boggy south
slope of Hawk&#8217;s Tor on the Hawkstor Downs in the
parish of Blisland. The circle itself is about 148 feet
in diameter, and the whole monument is, in Lukis&#8217;s
opinion, the most interesting and remarkable in the
country. Surrounding the platform is a ditch 11 feet
wide, and beyond that a penannular vallum about 10
feet in width. The peculiarity of the vallum is that it
has three bastions situate on the north-east, north-west,
and east sides. It is to the north-east bastion that I
wish to refer.</p>

<p>Sighting from the huge monolith, which is now<span class="pagenum" id="Page293">[293]</span>
prostrate but originally marked the centre of the circle,

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXVIII</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE CLOCK-STARS IN EGYPT AND BRITAIN.</span></h2>

<p>I have now finished my astronomical reconnaissance
of the British monuments. I trust I have shown how
important it is that my holiday task should be followed
by a serious inquiry by other workers so that the
approximate values with which I have had to content
myself for want of time may be replaced by others to
which the highest weight can be attached. This means
at each circle reversed observations with a six-inch
theodolite and determination of azimuths by means of
observations of the sun if necessary.</p>

<p>I propose in the present chapter to bring together
the general results already obtained in cases where the
inquiry has been complete enough to warrant definite
conclusions to be drawn.</p>

<p>The first result to be gathered from the observations,
and one to which I attach the highest importance, is
that the practice, so long employed in Egypt, of determining
time at night by the revolution of a star round
the pole, was almost universally followed in the British
circles. This practice was to watch a first-magnitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page295">[295]</span>
star, which I named a &#8220;clock-star,&#8221;<a href="#Footnote119" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor119">[119]</a> of such a declination
that it just dipped below the northern horizon so
that it was visible for almost the whole of its path.</p>

<p>Doubtless this same method of determining the flow
of time during the night watches was also employed
in Babylonia,<a href="#Footnote120" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor120">[120]</a> but there, alas! the temples, or, in other
words, the astronomical observatories, have disappeared,
so that only the Egyptian practice remains for us to
study.</p>

<h3><i>Egypt.</i></h3>

<p>Let us, before we proceed, consider some results which
have been gathered from the study of the Egyptian
observations.</p>

<p>One of the earliest temples in Egypt concerning which
we have historical references to check the orientation
results was built to carry on these night observations
at Denderah, lat. N. 26&deg; 10&#8242;. The star observed was
&#945; Ursae Majoris, decl. N. 58&deg; 52&#8242;, passing 5&deg; below the
northern horizon; date (assuming horizon 1&deg; high) about
4950 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, <i>i.e.</i>, in the times of the Shemsu Heru, before
Mena, as is distinctly stated in the inscriptions.</p>

<p>After &#945; Ursae Majoris had become circumpolar in the
latitude of Denderah, &#947; Draconis, which had ceased to be
circumpolar, and so fulfilled the conditions to which I
have referred, replaced it. Its declination was 58&deg; 52&#8242; N.
about 3100 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and it, therefore, could have been
watched rising in the axis prolonged of the old temple
in the time of Pepi, who restored it then, no doubt on<span class="pagenum" id="Page296">[296]</span>
account of the advent of the new star, and is stated to
have deposited a copy of the old plan in a cavity in
the new walls.</p>

<p>Here, then, we have two dates given by orientation
of a clock-star temple entirely agreeing with the most
recent views of Egyptian chronology.</p>

<p>In Dr. Budge&#8217;s <i>History of Egypt</i> (iii. 14) the story
of the rebuilding of the temple at Annu by Usertsen
(2433 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, Brugsch) is given from an ancient roll. Supposing
this temple built parallel with the faces of the
remaining obelisk, &#947; Draconis would rise in its axis
prolonged 2500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, proving that Usertsen did at Annu
what Pepi previously did at Denderah, and that the
same reason for restoration and even the same star
were in question.<a href="#Footnote121" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor121">[121]</a></p>

<p>When the clock-star ceased to be visible in the chief
temple other subsidiary temples were subsequently built
to watch it. Thus &#947; Draconis was watched at Thebes
from 3500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> to the times of the Ptolemys by temples
oriented successively from that of Mut Az. N. 72&deg; 30&#8242; E.
to 68&deg; 30&#8242;, 63&deg; 30&#8242;, and 62&deg;.<a href="#Footnote122" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor122">[122]</a></p>

<p>It is worth while to show that what we know now of
the Egyptian methods of observation enables us to carry
the matter further, while we gather at the same time
that in consequence of the difference of latitude the
method employed in Egypt could not be followed in
Britain.</p>

<p>I showed in the <i>Dawn of Astronomy</i> that several
ancient shrines consisted of two temples at right angles<span class="pagenum" id="Page297">[297]</span>
to each other (see <a href="#Fig13">Fig. 13</a>), one axis pointing high N.E.
to observe the clock-star&mdash;the worship of Set&mdash;the
other low N.W. to observe either the sun by itself, or
in association with some important star of the same
declination as the sun.</p>

<p>The temples of Mut and Menu (or Min), and of Amen,
with the associated temple M. of Lepsius, at Karnak, are
the best extant examples of this principle of temple
building.</p>

<p>There is evidence that both at Annu and Memphis
the same principle was followed, but at Annu one
obelisk alone remains, and at Memphis one temple; from
these, however, Captain Lyons and myself have obtained
sufficient data to enable the original directions of the
temple-systems to be gathered.</p>

<p>At Denderah, if such a N.W. temple ever existed it
has disappeared, but as the monument stands there
are still two temples at right angles to each other, but
the second one faces S.E. instead of N.W.</p>

<p>This premised, I will now give, in anticipation of
another one dealing with the British monuments, a list
of the most ancient star temples in Egypt, with their
azimuths and the first-magnitude clock-stars which
could have been observed in them at different dates.
These dates have been approximately determined by
the use of a precessional globe, an horizon of 1&deg; elevation
being assumed. As I have shown, the present
views of Egyptian chronology and the inscriptions carry
us back to &#945; Ursae Majoris, at Denderah. But there is
a suggestion at Luxor, and perhaps also at Abydos, that
Vega was used before that star, though there are, so
far as I know, no temple traces of Arcturus.</p>

<p>There is a very great difference between determining
the date of a temple erected to the rising or
setting of a particular star, and of one erected to the
rising or setting of the sun on a particular day of
the year. In the latter case no date can be given
unless we have reason to believe that both the sun
<i>and</i> a star rose or set at the same point of the
horizon at the same date; in other words, the sun and
star had the same declination, and the rising or setting
of both could be seen in the same temple.</p>

<p>I assumed, without historical data, that this view
was acted on in Egypt, at the temple of Menu; Mr.
Penrose found, with historical data, that it was actually
acted on in Greece at the Parthenon. To show that
we are at all justified in this view we must study
the association of gods with temple worship, and look
for temples in different azimuths erected at different
times if the god is a star; and we can run the star home
if the dates fall in with the star&#8217;s precessional change.
Thus there is reason for supposing that the god Ptah
and the star Capella were associated. There is a
temple of Ptah at Memphis, Az. N. 77&deg; 15&#8242; W., hills
50&#8242;, decl. N. 11&deg;, star Capella, date 5200. In the rectangular
system at Memphis, then, &#945; Ursae Majoris<span class="pagenum" id="Page299">[299]</span>
was watched in one temple and Capella in the other at
that date. There is also evidence that the god Menu
was associated with the star Spica. In the temple
system of Mut at Thebes, in 3200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, &#947; Draconis
was used as a clock-star in one temple, while the
setting of Spica was watched in the other.</p>

<p>If a temple is erected to the sun with no specially
named cult, it may be a sun-temple pure and simple,
not connected with star worship because there was no
star with the proper declination at the time.</p>

<p>In Greece temple-building was carried on at a much
later time, so late that perhaps water clocks were
available, so that we should not expect to find many
clock-star temples in that country. As a matter of
fact there is only one, of which the data, according
to Mr. Penrose, are as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It will be seen that the star used in Greece was the
last clock-star traced in the Egyptian temples.</p>

<h3><i>Britain.</i></h3>

<p>I now come to Britain. So far as my inquiries
have gone, these clock-star observations were introduced
into these islands about 2300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In my statement concerning them I will deal with
the astronomical conditions for lat. 50&deg; N., as it is in
Cornwall that the evidence is most plentiful and
conclusive.</p>

<p>In that latitude and at that time Arcturus, decl. N.<span class="pagenum" id="Page300">[300]</span>
41&deg;, was just circumpolar with a sea horizon, and
therefore neither rose nor set. Capella, decl. N. 31&deg;,
when northing was 9&deg; below the horizon, so that it
rose and set in azimuths N. 37&deg; E. and N. 37&deg; W.
respectively; it was therefore invisible for a long time
and was an awkward clock-star in consequence.</p>

<div class="figcenter w600" id="Fig61">

<img src="images/illo312.png" alt="" width="600" height="421" />

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 61.</span>&mdash;Arcturus and Capella as clock-stars in Britain.</p>

<p class="caption center">AB = sea horizon.<br />
A&#8242;B&#8242; = horizon 3&deg; high.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p><a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a> represents diagrammatically the conditions
named, the circumpolar paths of Arcturus and Capella
being shown by the smaller and larger circle respectively.
<i>A B</i> represents the actual sea horizon and
<i>A&#8242; B&#8242;</i> a locally raised horizon 3&deg; high, whilst the
dotted portion of the larger circle represents the non-visible
part of Capella&#8217;s apparent path.</p>

<p>What the British astronomer-priests did, therefore, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page301">[301]</span>
the majority of cases was to set up their temples
in a locality where the N.E. horizon was high, so that
Arcturus rose and set over it and was invisible for only
a short time, as shown in the diagram by the raised
horizon <i>A&#8242; B&#8242;</i>.</p>

<p>The two lists following contain the names of the monuments
where I suggest Arcturus was used as a clock-star.
In the first, the angular elevation of the sky-line
as seen from the circle in each case has been actually
measured, and the date of the alignment is, therefore,
fairly trustworthy; but in the second list the elevations
have been estimated from the differences of contour
shown on the one-inch Ordnance map, and the dates
must be accepted as open to future revision.</p>

<p>At the Merry Maidens, however, with nearly a sea
horizon, when Arcturus ceased to be circumpolar and
rose in Azimuth N. 11&deg; 45&#8242; E., it replaced Capella, and
was used as a clock-star after 1600 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>In this system of night observation we have the germ
of the use in later times of an instrument called the &#8220;night-dial,&#8221;
specimens of which, dating from the fourteenth
century, can be seen in our museums. The introduction<span class="pagenum" id="Page303">[303]</span>
of graduated circles permitted the employment of circumpolar
stars, and the &#8220;guards&#8221; of the Little Bear or
the &#8220;pointers&#8221; of the Great Bear were thus used.
There was a disc with a central aperture through which
the pole star could be observed; the disc could be adjusted
for every night in the year; an arm was then moved round
so that the direction of the pointers (or the guards) with
regard to the vertical could be measured; on a second
concentric circle the time of night could be read off.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXIX</span><br />
<span class="h2name">A SHORT HISTORY OF SUN TEMPLES</span></h2>

<h3><i>The Original Cult</i></h3>

<p>I have given detailed evidence showing that the first
circle builders in Britain worshipped the May-year sun,
whether they brought it with them or not. This year
was used in Babylon, Egypt, and afterwards in Greece.
In the two former countries May was the harvest month,
and thus became the chief month in the year. The dates
were apt to vary with the local harvest time.</p>

<p>The earliest extant temple aligned to the sun at this
festival seems to have been that of Ptah at Memphis,
5200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> I have already referred to this temple in
relation to the clock-star observations carried on in it.</p>

<p>This approximate date of the building of the temple is
obtained by the evidence afforded (1) by the associated
clock-star (see <a href="#Page298">p. 298</a>), and (2) by the fact that the god
Ptah represented the star Capella, since there is a Ptah
temple at Thebes aligned on Capella at a later time,
when by the processional movement it had been carried
outside the solar limit. There was also a similar temple
at Annu (Heliopolis, lat. N. 30&deg; 10&#8242;), but it has disappeared.
The light of the sun fell along the axis when<span class="pagenum" id="Page305">[305]</span>
the sun had the declination N. 11&deg;, the Gregorian dates
being April 18 and August 24.</p>

<p>Another May-year temple was that of Menu at Thebes,
Az. N. 72&deg; 30&#8242; W. (lat. N. 25&deg;; sun&#8217;s declination N. 15&deg;;
Gregorian date, May 1).</p>

plan of the Palace of Sennacherib discovered in the mound of
Kouyunjik. The temple axis, XXXVI., XXXIV., XXIX., XIX. (XXII. is
on a lower level), faces the rising of the May sun.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>As we have seen (<a href="#Page299">p. 299</a>), Spica had this declination in
3200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and the coincidence may have been the reason<span class="pagenum" id="Page306">[306]</span>
for the erection, or, more probably, the restoration, of
the temple,<a href="#Footnote123" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor123">[123]</a> especially as &#947; Draconis came into play
as a new clock-star at the same date.</p>

<p>The researches of Mr. Penrose in Greece have provided
us with temples oriented to the May-year sun. I shall
return to them afterwards, as they are later in time than
the British monuments.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 65</span>.&mdash;The Temples at Chichen Itza.</p>

</div><!--image-->

<p>The explorations of Sir H. Layard at Nineveh, lat.
36&deg; N., have shown that the temple in Sennacherib&#8217;s
palace, which may have been a restoration of a much
older temple, was also oriented to the May sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page308">[308]</span></p>

<p>It is a pity that our present-day arch&aelig;ologists do not
more strictly follow the fine example set by Sir Henry
Layard in his explorations of Kouyunjik. When he
had unearthed Sennacherib&#8217;s palace (700 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>) he was
careful to give the astronomical and magnetic bearings
of the buildings and of the temple which seemed to
form the core of them. The bearing is Az. N. 68&deg; 30&#8242; E.,
giving the sun&#8217;s declination as N. 16&deg;.</p>

<p>I am enabled by the kindness of Mr. John Murray
to give copies of the plans which Sir H. Layard prepared
of the excavations both at Kouyunjik and
Nimrood, showing the careful orientation which enables
us to claim Sennacherib&#8217;s temple as one consecrated
to the May year, while at Nimrood (Babylon) the
equinoctial worship was in vogue as at the pyramids.</p>

<p>In association with these plans of Layard&#8217;s, I give
another by Mr. Maudslay of the as carefully oriented
temples at Chichen Itza (N. lat. 20&deg;) explored by
him. In these temples, of unknown date and origin,
the azimuths of two show that the May year was
worshipped.<a href="#Footnote124" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor124">[124]</a></p>

<h3><i>The May-Year Monuments in Britain.</i></h3>

<p>In the first glimpses of the May year in Egypt we
have dates from 5000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> It does not follow that it
did not reach Great Britain before about 2000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
because monuments made their appearance about that
time. It is clear, also, that with the possibilities of
coastwise traffic as we have found it, it might as easily
have reached Ireland by then; 2000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, therefore, is
a probable date for the May worship to have reached
Britain arguing on general principles; we now come to
a detailed summary of the facts showing that it really
reached Britain earlier.</p>

<p>Alignments in British monuments designed to mark
the place of the sun&#8217;s rising or setting on the quarter-days
of the May year have been found as <span class="nowrap">follows:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>I have already shown that it was the practice in
ancient times for the astronomer-priests not only to<span class="pagenum" id="Page310">[310]</span>
watch the clock-stars during the night, but also other
stars which rose or set about an hour before sunrise,
to give warning of its approach on the days of the
principal festivals.</p>

<p class="blankbelow75">Each clock-star, if it rose and set very near the
north point, might be depended on to herald the
sunrise on <i>one</i> of the critical days of the year, but
for the others other stars would require to be observed.
This practice was fully employed in Britain.</p>

<p class="blankbelow75">The warning stars at Athens were the Pleiades for
temples facing the east, and Antares for temples using
the western horizon.</p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>August warnings.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline blankbelow75">&mdash;Sunrise at the August festival was
heralded by the rising of Arcturus, which, as we have
seen, was also used as a clock-star. The alignments
and dates given in the Arcturus table therefore hold
good for August. At the Hurlers, where the hill over
which Arcturus was observed fell away abruptly, we
find Sirius supplanting Arcturus as the warning star
for August in 1690 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>November warnings.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;So far I have discovered no
evidence that any star was employed to herald the
November sun. There may be two reasons for this.
In the first place the November festival &#8220;Halloween&#8221;
took place at sun<i>set</i> and the sun itself could be watched,
no heralding star being necessary.</p>

<p class="blankbelow75">Secondly, the atmospheric conditions which prevail in
Britain during November would not be conducive to
the making of stellar observations <i>at the horizon</i>, and
only risings or settings were observed with regard to
the quarter-days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page312">[312]</span></p>

<h4 class="inline"><i>February Warnings.</i></h4>

<p class="hinline">&mdash;In the same way that Arcturus
served the double purpose of clock-star and herald for the
August sun, so did Capella serve to warn the February
sun in addition to its use at night. The alignments
and dates given in the Capella table will therefore hold
good for its employment at the February quarter-day.</p>

<h3><i>The Solstitial Year Monuments.</i></h3>

<p>In Egypt generally, the solstitial worship followed
that of the May and equinoctial years. The religion of
Thothmes III. and the Rameses was in greatest vogue
2200-1500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>We find little trace of it in Greece proper, though
Mr. Penrose has traced it in Calabria and Pompeii, and
in some of the islands.</p>

<p>The solstitial cult was born in Egypt; it is a child
of the Nile-rise. I have shown in my <i>Dawn of
Astronomy</i> that the long series of temples connected
with the solstice may have commenced about 3000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>;
but for long it was a secondary cult; it was parochial
until the twelfth dynasty, say 2300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> Egypt&#8217;s solstitial
&#8220;golden age&#8221; may be given as 1700 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and her
influence abroad was very great, so that much travel,
&#8220;coastwise&#8221; and other, may be anticipated. It is for
some centuries after the first date that the introduction
of the solstitial worship into Britain may be anticipated.
It, for instance, is quite probable that the pioneers of this
worship should have reached Stonehenge in 2000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span></p>

<p>We find plentiful evidence that the worship of the
solstitial sun such as was carried on in Egypt at
Karnak and at other places<a href="#Footnote125" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor125">[125]</a> was introduced into
Britain some time after the May-year worship was
provided for in the monuments.</p>

<p>Although some of the alignments already discovered
are in all probability solstitial, the variation of the sun&#8217;s
solstitial declination is so slow and takes place between
such narrow limits that a most careful determination of
the actual azimuths and of the angular heights of the
various horizons must be made before any definite conclusion
as to dates can be arrived at. The necessity
for this care is illustrated in the paper on Stonehenge<a href="#Footnote126" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor126">[126]</a>
communicated to the Royal Society by Mr.
Penrose and myself in 1891, where, after taking the
greatest precautions, the resulting date was in doubt to
the amount of 200 years in either direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page314">[314]</span></p>

<p>So far Stonehenge is the only temple at which these
observations have been made, so that for the other
alignments contained in the following list no dates
can yet be given.</p>

<p>I cited an alignment at the Hurlers which marked
the rising point of Betelgeuse. This star warned the
summer solstice sunrise at about the Hurlers&#8217; date. So
far, however, I have not yet found any suggestion of
its use elsewhere.</p>

<p>At Shovel Down and Challacombe on Dartmoor there
are avenues pointing a few degrees west of north. The
sight-lines along these avenues would mark the
setting-point of Arcturus at the time that that star
(setting) warned the rising of the sun at the summer
solstice; but this use cannot be considered as established,
as Arcturus would scarcely set before its light was
drowned in that of the rising sun. The absence of<span class="pagenum" id="Page315">[315]</span>
darkness in high summer in these latitudes and the
bad weather in the winter may both be responsible
for so few alignments for the solstices.</p>

<h2><span class="h2number">CHAPTER XXX</span><br />
<span class="h2name">THE LIFE OF THE ASTRONOMER-PRIESTS</span></h2>

<p>The facts contained in the preceding chapters have
suggested, at all events, that whatever else went on
some four thousand years ago in the British circles
there was much astronomical observation and a great
deal of preparation for it.</p>

<p>In a colony of the astronomer-priests who built and
used the ancient temples we had of <span class="nowrap">necessity:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>(1) Observatories, <i>i.e.</i>, circles in the first place; next
something to mark the sight-lines to the clock-star for
night work, to the rising or setting of the warning stars,
and to the places of sunrise and sunset at the chief festivals.
This something, we have learned, might be another
circle, a standing stone, a dolmen, a cove, or a holed
stone.</p>

<p>A study of the sight-lines shows us that these collimation
marks, as we may call them, were of set
purpose, generally placed some distance away from the
circles, so far that they would require to be illuminated
in some way for the night and dawn observations.
When there was no wind, one or more hollows in a
stone, whether a menhir or a quoit, might have held<span class="pagenum" id="Page317">[317]</span>
grease to feed a wick or a pine-wood torch. But in a
wind some shelter would be necessary, and the light
might have been used in a cromlech or all&eacute;e couverte.
Stones have been found with such cups, and d&eacute;bris of
fires have been found in cromlechs.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that here there was no oil
as in the Semitic countries whence, as we have seen,
the immigrants came; and it was not a question of a
light on the sight-line alone. If wood were used, it
must have been kept dry for use, and whether wood or
animal fat were employed the most practical and convenient
way of lighting up would have been to keep a
fire ever burning in some sheltered place.</p>

<p>(2) Dwellings, which would be cromlechs or many-chambered
barrows, according to the number of astronomer-priests
at the station. These dwellings would
require to be protected against the invasions of the
local fauna, very different from what it is now, and for
this a small, and on that account easily blocked, entrance
would be an essential.</p>

<p>These dwellings would naturally suggest themselves
as the shelter place for the ever-burning fire or the
supply of dry wood. Tradition points with no uncertain
sound to the former existence of life and light
in these &#8220;hollow hills.&#8221; Mr. MacRitchie&#8217;s book<a href="#Footnote127" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor127">[127]</a> contains
a mine of most valuable and interesting information
on this subject.</p>

<p>(3) A water supply for drinking and bathing, which
might be a spring, river or lake, according to the
locality.</p>

<p>Given a supply of food we have now provided for<span class="pagenum" id="Page318">[318]</span>
the shelter and protection of the astronomer and the
man.</p>

<p>But the man who brought this new astronomical
knowledge was, before he came, astrologer and magician
as well, and, further, he was a priest; hence on account
of his knowledge of the seasons, he could not only
help the aboriginal tiller of the soil as he had never
been helped before, by his knowledge; but he could
appeal in the strongest way to his superstitious fears
and feelings, by his function as the chief sacrificer and
guardian of the sacrificial altars and fires. Hence it
was that everything relating to the three different
classes of things to which I have referred was regarded
as very holy because they were closely associated with
the astronomer-priests, on whom the early peoples depended
for guidance in all things, not only of economic,
but of religious, medical and superstitious value.</p>

<p>The perforated stones were regarded as sacred, so
that passing through them was supposed to cure disease.
Whether men and women, or children only,
passed through the hole depended upon its size. But a
hole large enough for a head to be inserted was good
for head complaints.</p>

<p>The wells, rivers, and lakes used by the priests were,
as holy places, also invested with curative properties, and
offerings of garments (skins?), and pins to fasten them
on, as well as bread and wine and cheese, were made at
these places to the priests.</p>

<p>The fact that the tree on which the garment was hung
was either a rowan or a thorn shows that these offerings
commenced as early as the May-November worship.</p>

<p>The holed stones, besides being curative, were in long<span class="pagenum" id="Page319">[319]</span>
after years, when marriage had been instituted, used for
the interchange of marriage vows by clasping hands
through the opening.</p>

<p>The cups for the light would also be sacred objects;
and many of them have been since used for holy
water.</p>

<p>The cursus at Stonehenge and the avenues on Dartmoor
may be regarded as evidences that sacred processions
formed part of the ceremonial on the holy days,
but sacrifices and sacred ceremonials were not alone in
question; many authors have told us that feasts, games
and races were not forgotten. This, so far as racing is
concerned, is proved, I think, by the facts that the
cursus at Stonehenge is 10,000 feet long and 350 feet
broad, that it occupies a valley between two hills, thus
permitting of the presence of thousands of spectators,
and that our horses are still decked in gaudy trappings
on May Day.</p>

<p>Nor is this all. It is hard to understand some of
the folklore and tradition unless we recognise that at
a time before marriage was instituted, at some of the
sacred festivals the intercourse of the sexes was permitted
if not encouraged. This view is strengthened
by the researches of Westermarck<a href="#Footnote128" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor128">[128]</a>
and Rhys.<a href="#Footnote129" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor129">[129]</a> Given
such a practice, the origin of matriarchal customs and
of the <i>couvade</i> is at once explained; and it is clear
that the charges against the Druids of special cruelty
and impurity must be withdrawn. Their sacrifices and
customs were those common to all priesthoods in the
ancient world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page320">[320]</span></p>

<p>I have shown that some circles used in the worship
of the May year were in operation 2200 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, and that
there was the introduction of a new cult about 1600 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>,
or shortly afterwards, in southern Britain, so definite
that the changes in the chief orientation lines in the
stone circles can be traced.</p>

<p>To the worship of the sun in May, August, November
and February was added a solstitial worship in June
and December.</p>

<p>The associated phenomena are that the May-November
Balder and Beltaine cult made much of the rowan and
may thorn. The June-December cult brought the worship
of the mistletoe.</p>

<p>The flowering of the rowan and thorntree in May,
and their berries in early November, made them the
most appropriate and striking floral accompaniments of
the May and November worships, and the same ideas
would point to a similar use of the mistletoe in June
and December.</p>

<p>The fact that the June-December cult succeeded and
largely replaced the May-November one could hardly
have been put in a cryptic and poetic statement more
happily than it appears in folklore: Balder was killed
by mistletoe.</p>

<p>This change of cult may be due to the intrusion of
a new tribe, but I am inclined to attribute it to a new
view taken by the priests themselves due to a greater
knowledge, among it being the determination, in Egypt,
of the true length of the year which could be observed
by the recurrence of the solstices, and of the intervals
between the festivals reckoned in days.</p>

<p>However this may have been, all the old practices<span class="pagenum" id="Page321">[321]</span>
and superstitions were retained, only the time of year
at which they took place was changed. As the change
of cult was slow, in any one locality the celebrations
would be continued at <i>both</i> times of the year, and for
long both sets of holidays were retained.</p>

<p>Since I have shewn that the solstitial worship came
last, traces of this, as a rule, would be most obvious in
places where it eventually prevailed over the cult of
the May year. In such places the absence of traces of
the May festival would be no valid argument against
its former prevalence. In other places, like Scotland,
where the solstitial cult was apparently introduced late
and was never prevalent, we should expect strong traces
of the May worship, and, as a matter of fact, it is very
evident in the folk lore and customs of Scotland; even
the old May year quarter days are still maintained.</p>

<p>Between the years 2300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> and 1600 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>, whether
we are dealing with the same race of immigrants or
not, we pass from unhewn to worked stones. The
method of this working and its results have been
admirably shown to us by Prof. Gowland&#8217;s explorations
at Stonehenge.</p>

<p>From the tables, given in Chap. XXVIII, it can be
seen that, so far as the present evidence goes, there was a
pretty definite time&mdash;about 2300 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>&mdash;of beginning the
astronomical work at the chief monuments; Cornwall
came first, Dartmoor was next.</p>

<p>Almost as marked as the simultaneous beginning are
the dates of ending the observations, if we may judge of
the time of ending by the fact that the precessional
changes in the star places were no longer marked by
the marking out of new sight lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page322">[322]</span></p>

<p>The clock-star work was the first to go, about 1500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span>
The May-warning stars followed pretty quickly.</p>

<p>We may say, then, that we have full evidence of
astronomical activity of all kinds at the circles for a
period of some 700 years.</p>

<p>What prevented its continuance on the old lines? It
may have been that the invention of some other method
of telling time by night had rendered the old methods
of observation, and therefore the apparatus to carry them
on, no longer necessary.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it may have been that some new
race, less astronomically inclined, had swept over the land.</p>

<p>I am inclined to take the former view. It is quite
certain that for the clock-stars other observations besides
those on the horizon would soon have suggested themselves
for determining the lapse of time during the night.
The old, high, bleak, treeless moorlands might then in
process of time have been gradually forsaken, and life
may have gone on in valleys and even in sheltered woods,
except on the chief festivals. When this was so astronomy
and superstition would give way to politics and
other new human interests, and the priests would become
in a wider sense the leaders and the teachers of the
more highly organised community.</p>

<p>It is clear that in later days as at the commencement
they were still ahead in the knowledge of the time. &#8220;Hi
terrae mundique magnitudinem et formam, motus coeli
ac siderum, ac quod dii velunt sciere profitentur&#8221; is
Pomponius Mela&#8217;s statement concerning them.<a href="#Footnote130" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor130">[130]</a> From
1500 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> to C&aelig;sar&#8217;s time is a
long interval, and yet<span class="pagenum" id="Page323">[323]</span>
the astronomical skill of the so-called Druids, who beyond
all question were the descendants of our astronomical-priests,
was then a matter of common repute. C&aelig;sar&#8217;s
account of the Druids in Gaul (<i>Bello Gallico</i>, vi. c.
13, 14, 15) is extremely interesting because it indicates,
I think, that the Druid culture had not passed through
Gaul and had therefore been waterborne to Britain,
whither the Gauls therefore went to study it.<a href="#Footnote131" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor131">[131]</a></p>

<p>Simultaneously with the non-use of the ancient stones,
we may imagine that the priests&mdash;of ever-increasing
importance&mdash;no longer dwelt in their cromlechs, but,
rather, occupied such buildings as those which remain
at Chysoister, and from this date it is possible that
burials may have taken place in some of the mounds
then given up as dwelling places. As sacred places
they were subsequently used for burials, as Westminster
Abbey has been; but burials were not the object of
their erection.<a href="#Footnote132" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor132">[132]</a> This new habit may have started the
practice of cist burial by later people in barrows thrown
up for that special purpose.</p>

<p>I cannot close this Chapter without expressing my
admiration of the learning and acumen displayed by
Dr. Borlase in his treatment of the subject of the Druids
in his <i>History of Cornwall</i>, published in 1769; I find
he has anticipated me in suggesting that the hollowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page324">[324]</span>
stones were used for fires. It is clear, now that the monuments
have been dated, that the astronomical knowledge
referred to by C&aelig;sar and Pomponius Mela was no new
importation; if, therefore, the present view of ethnologists
that the Celtic intrusion took place about 1000 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> is
correct, it is certain the Celts brought no higher intelligence
with them than was possessed by those whom
they found here; nor is this to be expected if, as the
inquiry has suggested, the latter were the representatives
of the highest civilisation of the East with which possibly
the former had never been brought into contact.</p>

<p>The mean of the two determinations gives for the azimuth of
Salisbury Spire S. 9&deg; 8&#8242; 2&#8243; E. This result agrees well with the
value of the azimuth communicated by the Ordnance Survey
Office, namely, 9&deg; 4&#8242; 8&#8243; from the centre of the circle, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page327">[327]</span>
being corrected by +4&#8242; 12&#8243; for the position of station <i>a</i>, is increased
to 9&deg; 8&#8242; 20&#8243;.</p>

<p>Hence, from the point of observation <i>a</i>, 9&deg; 8&#8242; 20&#8243; has been

<p>The difference of 8<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>&#8242; between this and the assumed axis
49&deg; 34&#8242; 18&#8243; is so slight that considering the indirect method which
has necessarily been employed in determining the axis of the

verticality, parallelism and straightness of the inner surfaces of

<p>The observation thus agrees with calculation, if we suppose
about 2&#8242; of the Sun&#8217;s limb to have been above the horizon when it
was made, and therefore substantially confirms the azimuth above
given of the Friar&#8217;s Heel and generally the data adopted.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page329">[329]</span></p>

<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Hints on Making, and Method of Reducing, the
Field Observations.</span></h3>

<p>It will probably be found useful if I give here a few hints as to
the precautions which must be taken in making the field observations
and an example of their reduction to an astronomical
basis.</p>

<p>For the <i>azimuths</i> of the sight-lines the investigator of these
monuments cannot do better than use the 25-inch, or 6-inch, maps
published by the Ordnance Survey. Their accuracy is of a very
high order and is not likely to be exceeded, even if approached,
by any casual observer having to make his own special arrangements
for correct time before he can begin his surveying
work.</p>

<p>In some cases, however, it may be found that the Survey has not
included every outstanding stone which may be found by an
investigator on making a careful search; many of the stones are
covered by gorse, &amp;c., and are not, therefore, easily found.</p>

<p>In such cases the azimuth of some object that is marked on the
map should be taken as a reference line and the difference of
azimuth between that and the unmarked objects determined. By
this means the azimuths of all the sight-lines may be obtained.</p>

<p>When using the 25-inch maps for determining azimuths it
must be borne in mind that the side-lines are not, necessarily, due
north and south. The Director-General of the Ordnance Survey,
Southampton, will probably on application state the correction to
be applied to the azimuths on this account, and this should be
applied, of course, to each of the values obtained.</p>

<p>If for any reason it is found necessary or desirable to make
observations of the azimuths independently of the Ordnance
Survey, full instructions as to the method of procedure may be
found in an inexpensive instruction book<a href="#Footnote133" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor133">[133]</a> issued by the Board of
Education. The instructions given on p. 49, &sect; 3, are most<span class="pagenum" id="Page330">[330]</span>
generally applicable, and the form on p. 76 will be found very
handy for recording and reducing the observations.</p>

<p>In making observations of the angular elevation of the horizon
a good theodolite is essential. Both verniers should be read, the
mean taken, and then the telescope should be reversed in its
Ys, reset, and both readings taken again. One setting and
reading are of little use.</p>

<p>The Ordnance Survey maps may also be employed <i>in a
preliminary reconnaissance</i> to obtain approximate values of the
horizon elevations. This may be done by measuring the distances
and contour-lines shown on the one-inch maps. This method,
however, is only very roughly approximate owing to the fact that
sharp but very local elevations close to the monuments may not
appear on these maps and yet be of sufficient magnitude to cause
large errors in the results.</p>

<p>Where trees, houses, &amp;c., top the horizon, they should, of course,
be neglected and the elevation of the ground level, at that spot,
taken. Should the top of the azimuth mark (stone, &amp;c.) show above
the actual horizon, its elevation should be recorded and not that of
the horizon.</p>

<p>Having measured the angular elevation of the horizon along the
sight-line, it is necessary to convert this into actual zenith distance
and to apply the refraction correction before the computations of
declination can be made.</p>

<p>The process of doing this and of calculating the declination
will be gathered from the examples given <span class="nowrap">below:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore75"><i>Data.</i></p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Monument:&mdash;E. circle Tregeseal, lat. 50&deg; 8&#8242; N. <i>i.e.</i> colat = 39&deg; 52&#8242;.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Reference to the May-Sun curve, given on <a href="#Page263">p. 263</a>, indicates that
this is probably an alignment to the sunrise on May morning.
Therefore, in determining the zenith distance, the correction for
the sun&#8217;s semi-diameter (16&#8242;) must be taken into account, allowing
that 2&#8242; of the sun&#8217;s disc was above the horizon when the observation
was made.</p>

sun may be found by the following <span class="nowrap">equations:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="formula"><span class="formulanumber">(1)</span>
<span class="numberedformula">tan &#952; = tan <i>z</i>. cos A,</span></p>

<p class="noindent">where &#952; is the subsidiary angle which must be determined for the
purpose of computation, <i>z</i> is the true zenith distance, and A is the
distance from the <i>North</i> point.</p>

<p class="formula"><span class="formulanumber">(2)</span>
<span class="numberedformula">cos &#916; =
<span class="horsplit"><span class="top">cos <i>z</i> . cos
(c - &#952;)<a href="#Footnote134" class="fnanchor" id="FNanchor134">[134]</a></span>
<span class="bot">cos &#952;</span></span>,</span></p>

<p class="noindent">where &#916; is the N.P.D. of the celestial object, and <i>c</i> is the
colatitude (90&deg; - lat.) of the place of observation.</p>

<p>In the example taken this gives <span class="nowrap">us&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="formula"><span class="formulanumber">(1)</span>
<span class="numberedformula">tan &#952; = tan 88&deg; 21&#8242; . cos 66&deg; 38&#8242;</span></p>

<p class="formula nothigh">&#952; = 85&deg; 50&#8242; 45&#8243;</p>

<span class="horsplit"><span class="top">cos 88&deg; 21&#8242;. cos (39&deg; 52&#8242; - 85&deg; 50&#8242; 45&#8243;)</span>

<p class="formula nothigh">&#916; = 73&deg; 57&#8242; 50&#8243;</p>

<p class="formula nothigh">Declination, &#948;, = (90&deg; - &#916;) = 16&deg; 2&#8242; 10&#8243; N.</p>

<p>Reference to the Nautical Almanac shows that this is the sun&#8217;s
declination on May 5 and August 9. We may therefore conclude
that the Long-stone was erected to mark the May sunrise, as seen
from the Tregeseal Circle.</p>

<p>Had we been dealing with a star, instead of the sun, the only
modification necessary in the process of calculating the
declination would have been to omit the semi-diameter correction
of 14&#8242;.</p>

<p>Having obtained a declination, we must refer to the curves given
on <a href="#Page115">pp. 115</a>-<a href="#Page116">6</a> in order to see if there is any star which fits it, and
to find the date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page332">[332]</span></p>

<p>Take, for example, the case of the apex of Carn Kenidjack, as
seen from the Tregeseal <span class="nowrap">circle&mdash;</span></p>

<p>Az. = N. 12&deg; 8&#8242; E.; hill = 4&deg; 0.&#8242; lat. = 50&deg; 8&#8242;.</p>

<p>This gives us a declination of 42&deg; 33&#8242; N., and a reference to the
stellar-declination curves (<a href="#Page115">p. 115</a>-<a href="#Page116">6</a>) shows that Arcturus had that
declination in 2330 <span class="smcapall">B.C.</span> From the table given on <a href="#Page117">p. 117</a>, we
see that at that epoch Arcturus acted as warning-star for the
August sun.</p>

<p>In cases where the elevation of the horizon is 30&#8242;, or in
preliminary examinations, where it may be assumed as 30&#8242;, the
refraction exactly counterbalances the hill, and therefore the true
zenith distance at the moment of star-rise is 90&deg;. Hence the
N.P.D. of the star may be found from the following simple
<span class="nowrap">equation&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="formula"><span class="formulanumber">(3)</span>
<span class="numberedformula">cos &#916; = cos A cos &#955;</span></p>

<p class="noindent">where &#916; and A have the same significance as before and &#955; is the
<i>latitude</i> of the place of observation.</p>

<h2>Transcriber&#8217;s Notes</h2>

<p>Inconsistent, archaic and unusual spelling, hyphenation and capitalisation have been retained, except as mentioned
below. This includes proper and geographical names.</p>

<p>Depending on the hard- and software used, not all elements may display as intended. Some tables are best viewed
in a wide browser window.</p>

<p>Index: the occasional error in the order of entries has not been corrected.</p>

<p>For the illustrated versions: Where the quality of the illustration in the source
document permits and where the visibility of details in or the legibility of
the illustration requires, larger versions of illustrations have been provided. Availability
of these larger illustrations depends on the version used.</p>

<p>Page 100, Fig. 27, Menhir (A): the reference letter is missing from the illustration.</p>

<p>Page 101, Carnac-Leomariaquer: probably Carnac-Locmariaquer (as on Page 38).</p>

<p>Footnote [124], table Chichen Itza, last line: the E. or W. is missing in the source document.</p>

<p class="blankbefore75">Changes made</p>

<p>Illustrations and tables have been moved out of text paragraphs; footnotes were moved to the end of the
chapter. Some tables have been re-arranged. Ditto marks have occasionally been replaced with the dittoed text.</p>

<p>Some obvious minor typographical and punctuation errors have
been corrected silently; some minor formatting inconsistencies have been standardised silently. Some Greek accents and diacritics
have been ignored.</p>

<p>Texts <span class="illotext">in dotted rectangles</span> are not present in the source document,
but have been transcribed from the illustrations where these may not provide sufficient visible detail.</p>

<p>Page 29: closing bracket inserted after 185-6 days respectively</p>

<p>Page 90, Fig. 24: reference letters A, B, C and D inside the illustration have been enlarged for better visibility.</p>

<p>Page 97: alignments changed to alignements; aujourdhui changed to aujourd&#8217;hui</p>

<p>Page 173, first table: 19&deg; 51&#8242; E. changed to N. 19&deg; 51&#8242; E.</p>

<p>Page 220: footnote marker [65] inserted after Rhys where it seems to fit best (lacking in source document).</p>
